BOOK VII. xm. 60—xv. 63

Lucius Sulla was his colleague, on the 9th April a
freeman of humble station at Fiesole named Gaius
Crispinius Hilarus went in procession preceded by
eight children, including two daughters, twenty-
seven grandchildren, eighteen great-grandchildren,
and eight granddaughters by marriage, and with all
of these in attendance offered sacrifice on the Capitol.

son by the daughter of his client Salonius when he was
81 z this is the reason why this branch of his family
bears the surname of Salonianus, although that of
the other branch is Licinianus; Cato of Utica be-
longed to the Salonian branch. Recently also
Lucius Volusius Saturninus, who died while holding
the office of City Praefect, is known to have had a
son, by Cornelia of the Scipio family, born after
he was 62, Volusius Saturninus, who was consul.
Parentage even up to the age of 75 is commonly
found in the lower classes.

growing old with the patient, sometimes when the
bowels are violently moved being ejected. A similar
object is also formed in thc stomach of males, called
a tumour, as in the case of the praetorian Oppius
