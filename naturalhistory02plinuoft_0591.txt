BOOK VII. xxx⁷111.1o4—106

But, although these cases exhibit great achieve- Exploics of
ments of valour, yet they involve still greater sermm
aehievements of fortune3 whereas nobody, in my
judgement at all events, can rightly rank any
human being above Marcus Sergius, albeit his
greatgrandson Catiline diminishes the credit of his
name. Sergius in his second campaign lost his right
hand; in two campaigns he was wounded twenty-
three times, with the result that he was crippled
in both hands and both feet, only his spirit being
intaet ; yet although disabled, he served in numerous
subsequent (τῑῑῐηρᾶἰιτης. He was twice taken prisoner
by Hannibal (for it w as with no ordin ary foe that
he was engaged), and twice escaped from Hannibal' s
fetters, although he was kept in chains or shackles
on every single d· iy for twenty months. He fought
four times with only his left hand, having two horses
he was riding stabbed under him. oHe had a
right hand oft> iron made for him and going into
aetion with it tied to his arm, raised the siege of
Cremona, saved Piacenza‚ captured twelve enemy
camps in Gaul: all of which exploits are testified
by his speech delivered during his praetorship when
his colleagues wanted to debar him from the sacri-
fices as infirm—a rnan who with a different foe would
have accumulated what piles of w·!1eaths inasmueh
as it makes the‹r·10atest difference with what period
of history a particular man's valour happens to
coincide. What civie xweaths were bestowed by
Trebbia or 'Iicino or Trasirneno? what crown was
won at Cannae, where successful ssight was valour’s
highest exploit?a All other victors truly have
conquered men, but Sergius vanquished fortune
also.
