BOOK 111.v. 54—56

separates the territory of Veii from that of Crustum-
ium, and afterwards that of Fidenae and Latium
from Vaticanum. But below the confluence of the
Chiana from Arezzo it is augmented by forty—two
tributaries, the chief being the Nera and the Severone
(which latter is itself navigable‚ and encloses Latium
in the rear), while it is Oequally increased by the
aqueducts and the numerous spiings cairied through
to the city3 and consequently it is navigable for
vessels of whatexer size from the Mediterranean‚
and is a most tranquil trafficker m the produce of all
the earth, with perhaps more villas on its banks
and overlooking it than all the other rivers in the
whole world. And no river is more circumscribed
and shut in on either side3 yet of itself it offers no
resistance‚ though it is subject to frequent sudden
floods‚ the inundations being nowhere greater than
in the city itself. But in truth it is looked upon
rather as a prophet of wax-ning, its rise being always
construed rather as a call to religion than as a threat

of disaster.

Old Latium has preserved the original limits, astum·

extending from the 'siber to Cerceii, a distance of
50 miles; so exiguous at the beginning were the
roots of the Empirc. Its inhabitants have often
changed: at various times it has been occupied by
various peoples—the Aborigines, the Pelasgi, the
Arcades, the Siculi, the Aurunci, the Rutuli, and
beyond Circello the Volsci, Osci and Ausones, owing
to which the name of Latium came to be extended as
far as the river Garigliano. To begin with there is
Ostia, a colony founded by a Roman king, the town
of Laurentum, the grove of Jupiter Indiges, the river
Numicius, and Ardea, founded by Danae the mother
