days’ row distant from Freemen’s Town,“ and a
centre to· which Cave—dwellers’ myrrh ⁶ is brought.
There are two ifflands off'the harbour cassed the
False Gates‚ and two inside it called the Gates‚ on
one of which are some stone monuments with
inscriptions in an unknown alphabet. Further on is
the Bay of.Abahto& and then [Modoruss Islandc
and other uninhabited islands, and also along the
mainland a stretch of desert3 the town of Gaza;
Mossylites Cape and Harbour, the latter the port
of export for cinnamon. This was the farthest
point to which Sesostrisd led his army.2 Some
writers place one Ethiopian town on the coast beyond
this point, Baragaza.s

Juba holds that at Cape Mossylites begins the
Atlantic Ocean‚ navigable with a north-west wind
along the coast of his kingdom of the Mauretanias
as far as Cadiz; and his whole opinion must not
be omitted at this point in the narrative. He puts
forward the view that the distance from the cape in
the Indian⁹ territory called in Greek the Narrow
Head, and by others the sickle, in a straight course
past Bumt Island to Malichas's Islands is 1500 miles,
from there to the place called Scaenei 225 miles,
and on from there to Sadanus Island 150 miles—-
making 1875 miles to the open sea. All the rest of
the authorities have held the view that the heat of
the sun makes the voyage impossible; moreover
actual goods conveycd for trade are exposed to the
depredations of an Arabian tribe living on the
islands: who are called the Ascitaeh because they
make rafts of timber placed on a pair of inflated
oxhides and practise piracy, using poisoned arrows.
