and Indian Ocean on the south3 and it is subdivided
into a variety of designations according to the bays
that it forms and the people dwelling on its coasts. A
great portion of Asia however also, adj oining the north,
owing to the severity of its frosty climate contains
vast deserts. From the extreme north-north—east to
the northernmost point at which the sun rises in
summer ‘² there are the Scythians, and outside of them
and beyond the point where north-north-east begins
some have placed the Hyperboreans, who are said
by a majority of authorities to be in Europe. After
that point the first place known is Lytharmis, a
promontory of Celtica, and the river Carambucis,
where the range of the Ripaean Mountains termin-
ates and with it the rigour of the climate relaxes;
here we have reports of a people called the Arim-
phaei, a race not unlike the Hyperboreans. They
dwell in forests and live on berries; long hair is
decmed to be disgraceful in the case of women and
men alike; and their manners are mild. Conse-
quently they are reported to be deemed a sacred race
and to be left unmolestcd even by the savage tribes
among their neighbours‚ this immunity not being con-
fined to themselves but extendcd also to people who
have fled to them for refuge. chond them we come
directly to the Scythians, Cimrnerians, Cissi, Anthi,
Georgl, and a race of Amazons, the last reaching to
the Caspian and Hyrcanian Sca.

the Scythian Ocean to the back of Asia, where the
inhabitants call it by a variety of namcS‚ but it is best
known by two of them, as the Caspian Sea and the
Hyrcanian. Clitarchus is of opinion that the Caspian
is as large as the Black Sea3 Eratosthenes also gives
