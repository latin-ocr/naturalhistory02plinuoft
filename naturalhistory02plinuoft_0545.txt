considered portentous‚ except in Egypt, where
drinking the water of the Nile causes fecundity.
Recently on the day of the obsequies of his late
Majesty Augustus a certain woman of the lower
orders named Fausta at Ostia was delivered of two
male and two female infants, which unquestionably
portended the food shortage that followed. We
also find the case of a woman in the Peloponnese who
four times produced quintuplets, the greater number
of each birth surviving. In Egypt also Trogus
alleges cases of seven infants born at a single
birth.

Persons are also born of both sexes combined—
what we call Hermaphrodites‚ formerly called
androgyni and considered as portents, but now as
entertainments. Pompey the Great among the
decorations of his theatre placed images of celebrated
marvels‚ made with special elaboration for the pur-
pose by the ‘calent of eminent artists3 among thern
we read of Eutychis who at Tralles was carried to
her funeral pyrc by twenty children and who had
given birth 30 times, and Alcippe who gave birth to
an elephant—although it is true that the latter case
ranks among portents, for one of the first occurrences
of the Marsian wara was that a maidservant gave
birth to a snake, and also monstrous births of various
kinds are recorded among the ominous things that
happened. Claudius Caesar writes that a hippo-
centaur was born in Thessaly and died the same day ;
and in his reign we actually saw one that was brought
here for him from Egypt preserved in honey. One
case is that of an infant at Saguntum which at once
went back into the womb, in the year‘) in which
that city was destroyed by Hannibal.
