begins; and each strip of land is sown as the flood
relinquishes it. It may be added that the Nile is
the only river that emits no exhalations.

It first comes within the territory of Egypt at the
Ethiopian frontier, at Assuan—that is the name of
the peninsula a mile in circuit in which, on the
Arabian side, the Camp is situated and off which

place where the Nile splits into two channels-——the
point at which, as we have said, the island called the
Delta begins. This is the distance given by Artemi-
dorus, who also states that the island formerly con-
tained 250 1011115 ; J uba, however, gives the distance
as 400 miles. Aristocreon says that the distance
from Elephantis to the sea is 750 miles—Elephantis
is an inhabited island 4 miles below the last cataract
and 16 above Assuan; it is the extreme limit
of navigation in Egypt, being 585 miles from Alex-
andria—so far out in their calculations have the
above-named authors been. Elephantis is the point
of rendezvous for Ethiopian vessels, which are made
collapsible for the purpose of portage on reaching
the cataracts.

past Egypt can claim the distinction of having had
in the reign“ of King Amasis 20‚000 cities3 and
even now it contains 3 very large number, although
of no importance. Howcver, the City of Apollo is
notable, as is also the City of Leucothea and the
Great City of Zeus, also called Thebes, renowned for
the fame of its hundred gates, Coptos the market
near the Nile for Indian and Arabian merchandise,
and also the Town of Venus and the Town of Jove
and Tentyris, below which is Abydos, famous for
