BOOK IV. ΧΠ. 81-83

Kingdom of Vannius‚⁰ the opposite side of the country
is occupied by the Basternae and then other German
tribes. Agrippa describes the whole of this area
from the Danube to the sea as being 1200 miles in
length by 396 in breadth‚ as far as the river Vistula
in the direction of the Sarmatian desert. The name
of Scythians has spread in every direction‚ as far is
the Sarmatae and the Germans, but this old design· ·ι-
tion has not continued for any except the most
outlying sections of these races, living almost unknown
to the rest of mankind.

After the Danube come the towns of Cremnisco}

the famous river Dniester, which gives its name to
the town on the site which previously was called
Ophiusa. A large island in the Dniester, inhabited
by the Tyragetae, is 130 miles from the False Mouth
of the Danube. Then come the Axiacae named
from the river Axiaces‚⁶ and beyond them the Cro-
byzi, the river Rhode, the Sangarian Gulf, the port of
Ordesus‚ and 120 miles from the Dniester the river
Dnieper and the lake and tribe of the same name,
and the town 15 miles inland from the sea, the old
names of which were Olbiopolis and Miletopolis.
Returning to the coast, we come to the Port of
the Achaeans and the Isle of Achilles, famous for
the tomb of that hero, and 125 miles from it a penin-
sula stretching out at a slant in the shapc ofa sword,
and called the Race-course of Achilles from having
been his exercising ground; its length is given by
Agrippa as 80 miles. The whole of this stretch
is occupied by the Scythian Sardi and Siraci.
Then there is a wooded region that has given its
name to the Forcst Sea that washes its coast3 the
