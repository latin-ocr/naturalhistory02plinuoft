Cambalidus, which is a spur of the Caucasus range3
from this point is the easiest route across to the
country of the Bactri.

The territory of Susa is separated from Elymais Susa.
by the river Karon, which rises in the country of
the Medes, and after running for a moderate distance
underground‚ comes to the surface again and flows
through Massabatene. It passes round the citadel
of Susa and the temple of Diana, which is regarded
with the greatest reverence by the races in those
parts 3 and the river itself is held in great veneration,
inasmuch as the kings drink water drawn from it
only, and consequently have it conveyed to places
a long distance away. Tributaries of the Kartin
are the Hedyphos, which flows past the Persian
town of Asylum, and the Aduna coming from the
territory of the Susiani. On the Karun lies the
town of Magoa, 15 miles from Charax—though
some people locate Magoa at the extreme edge of
the territory of Susa, close to the desert. Below
the Kariin on the coast is Elymais, which marches
with Farsistan and extends from the river
Oratis to the Charax, a distance of 240 miles; its
towns are Seleucia and Sostrate, situated on the
flank of Mount Chasirus. The coast lying in front,
as we have stated above, is rendered inaccessible §99-
by mud, like the Lesser Syrtes, as the rivers Brixa
and Ortacia bring down a quantity of sediment, and
the Elymais district is itself so marshy that it is only
possible to reach Farsistan by making a long detour
round it. It is also infested vm‘th snakes carried down
by the streams. A particularly inaccessible part of
it is called Characene, from Charax, a town of Arabia
that marks the frontier of these kingdoms; about
