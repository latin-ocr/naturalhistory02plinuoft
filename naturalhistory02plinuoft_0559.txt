BOOK VII. x11. 54-56

Serapio being a low chattel belonging to a dealer in
hogs. Another Scipio of a later generation received
his name from an actor Salutio, just as Spinther and
Pamphilus who played second and third roles re·-
spectively gave their names to the colleagues in the
consulship Lentulus and Metellus, a situation which

who complained especially about the large amount
of the price (he had bought them for 200‚000
sesterces); but the crafty dealer replied that the
thing protested about was precisely the cause of his
having charged so much, because there was nothing
remarkable in a likeness between any pair of twin
