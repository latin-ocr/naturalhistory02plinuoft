and Caspian Sea, but also by other Greek authors
who have stayed as guests with the Indian kings,
for instance Mega,sthenes and Dionysius sent by
Philadelphus for that purpose, and have also reported
as to the strength of these nations. Nev ertheless
there' 1s no possibility of being exact as to this matter,
so discrepant and so difficult to believe are the accounts
given. Those who accompanied Alexander the
Great have written that the region of India subdued
by him contained 5000 towns, nonc less than two
miles in circuit,‘² and nine nations, and that India
forms a third of the entire surface of the earth, and
that its populations are innumerable—which is
certainly a very probable theory, inasmuch as the
Indians are almost the only race that has never
migratcd from its own territory. From the time
of Father Liber to Alexander the Great 153 kings
of India are counted in a period of 6451 years and
three months. The rivers are of enormous size:
it is stated that Alexander sailing on the Indus did
never less thar 75 miles a day and yet could not
reach the mouth of the river in less time than {ive
months and a few days over, and nev erthcless it is
certain that the Indus is smaller than the Ganges.
Seneca also, who among our own writers essay ed
an account of India, gives its rivers as 60 in number
and its races as 118. It would be an equally laborious
task to enumerate its mountains; there is a con-
tinuous chain formed by Imavus‚ Hemodus, Paro-
panisus ὁ and Caucasus, from which the whole country
slopes down into an immense plain resembling that
of Egypt.
