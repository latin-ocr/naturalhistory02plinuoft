BOOK IV. xm. 92—94

XIII. In the Dardanelles there are no islands
that deserve mention belonging to Europe. There
are two in the Black Sea, ΝΞ miles from the European
coast and 14 miles from the mouth of the straits, the
Fanari‚ called by others the Symplegades, these
being the islands about which there is the tradition
that they once clashed together: the story is due
to the fact that they are separated by so small a
gap that by persons entering the Black Sea
directly facing them they were seen as two, and
then when the line of sight became slightly oblique
they gave the appearance of coming together. On
this side of the Danube there is one of the islands α
called Apollonia, 80 miles from the Thracian
Bosphorus; from this island Marcus Lucullus
brought the statue ὸ of Apollo of the Capitol. We
have stated the places in the Delta of the Danube.
Off the mouth of the Dnieper is the Island of
Achilles mentioned above, which also has the Greek
names of the White Island and Island of the Blest.
Modern investigation shows the position of this
island to be 140 miles from the Dnieper ‚ 120 from
the Dniester‚ and 50 from the island of Peuce. It is
about 10 miles in circuit. The remaining islands in
the Gulf of Carcinites are Cephalonnesus‚ Spodusa
and Macra. Before wc leave the Black Sea, we must
not omit the opinion held by many persons that all
the waters of the Mediterranean are derived from this
source, and not from the Straits of Gibraltar3 the
reason that they give for this view is not an improbable
one—viz, that the tide is always flowing out of the
Black Sea and never ebbing in the other direction.

Next we must leave the Black Sea to describe the
outer regions of Europe, and crossing the Ripaean
