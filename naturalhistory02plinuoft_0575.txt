sort are called ‘ apathetic ' by the Greeks, who have
known many men of the kind, and among them
surprising to say, chiefly founders of schools of
philosophy, Diogenes the Cynic, Pyrrho, Heraclitus,

nature are known to occur variously in many per-
sons, for instance in the case of Drusus's daughter
Antonia never spitting, in the poct and ex-consul
Pomponius never belching. Persons whose bones are
by nature solid,‘² a rather rare class, are called ‘ horny.'

XX. Varro in his account of cases of remarkable
strength records that one Tritanus, famous in the
gladiatorial exercise with the Sanmite equipment, was

him without a weapon in his hand, and finally took

Marcus Varro likewise states: ‘ Rusticelius, who was
nicknamed Hercules, used to lift his mule; Fufius
Salvius used to walk up a ladder with two hundred-
