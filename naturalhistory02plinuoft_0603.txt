BOOK VII. xxwr 121-122

XXXVI. Of filial affection there have it is true Eminence in
been unlimited instances all over the world, but {fflfflim
one at Rome with which the whole of the rest
could not compare. A plebeian woman of low
position and therefore unknown, who had just given
birth to a child, had permission to visit her mother
who had been shut up in prison as a punishment, and
was always searched in advance by the doorkeeper
to prevent her carrying in any food; she was
detected giving her mother sustenance from her
own breasts. In consequence of this marvel the
daughter’s pious affection was rewarded by the
mother’s release and both were awarded mainten-
ance for life3 and the place where it occurred was
consecrated to the Goddess concerned, a temple
dedicated to Filial Affection being built on the site
of the prison, where the Theatre of Marcellus now
stands, in the consulship α of Gaius Quinctius and
Manius Acilius. In the house of the father of the
Gracchi two snakes were caught, and in reply to
enquiry an oracle declared that he himself would
live if the snake of the other sex were killcd3 “ No‚’'
said he, ‘⁶ kill my snake: Cornelia is young and still
able to bear children.” This meant, to spare his
wife and think of the public interest3 and the result
prophesied soon followed. Marcus Lepidus after
divorcing his wife Appuleia died for love of her.
Publius Rutilius when suffering from a slight illness
received news of his brother’s defeat in his candi-
dature for the consulship, and at once expired.
Publius Catienus Philotimus loved his patron so
dearly that he threw himself upon his funeral
pyre, although left heir to the whole of his

property.
