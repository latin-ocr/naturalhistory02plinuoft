Sea, 350 miles⁰ distant from Cape Matapan in
Laconia and 225 miles from Crete itself. After the
cape of Ras Sem is Cyrene, 11 miles from the sea,
from Ras Sem to the harbour of Cyrene being 24
miles and to Ras El Tin 88 miles, from which it is
216 miles to the Canyon. The inhabitants of this

of the sands '. The territory of Cyrene for a
breadth of 15 miles from the coast is thought to be
good even for growing trees, but for the same space
further inland to grow only corn, and afterwards over
a strip 30 miles wide and 250 miles long nothing

After the Nasamones, we come to the dwellings
of the Asbytae and Macae3 and beyond them,

Amantes. These also are surrounded by sands in
the western direction, but nevertheless they find
water without difficulty at a depth of about three
feet, as the district receives the overflow of the
waters of Mauretania. They build their houses of
blocks of salt quarried out of their mountains like
stone. From these it is a journey of 7 days in a
south-westerly quarter to the Cave-dwellers‚ with
whom our only intercourse is the trade in the precious
stone imported from Ethiopia which we call the
carbuncle. Before reaching them, in the direction §26.

the Lesser Syrtis, is Fezzan, where we have subju-
