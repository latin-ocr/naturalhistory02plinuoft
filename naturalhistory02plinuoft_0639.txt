recovered from the pyre. This is the law of
mortals : we are born for these and similar accidents
of fortune, so that in the case of a human being no
confidence must be placed even in death. Among

other instances we find that the soul of Hermotimus ie

of Clazomenae used to leave his body and roam
abroad‚ and in its wan(le1·ings report to him from a
distance many things that only one present at them
could know of—his body in the meantime being only
half-conscious ; till finally some enemies of his named
the Cantharidae burned his body and so deprived his
soul on its return of what may be called its sheath.
We also read that the soul of Aristeas at Proconnesus
was seen flying out of his mouth in the shape of a
raven, with a great deal of fabulous invention that
follows this. This inventiveness I for my part also
receive in a similar way in the case of Epimenides of
Cnossus——that when a boy, being weary with the
beat and with travel, he slept in a cave 57 years,
and when he woke, just as if it had been on the
following day, was surprised at the appearance
of things and the change in them3 and afterwards
old age came on him in the same number of
days as he had slept years though nevertheless
he liv ed to the age of 157. The female sex
seems specially liable to this malady, caused by
distortion of the womb; if this is set right, the
breathing is restored. To this subject belongs the
essay of Heraclides, well known in Greece, about
the woman recalled to life after being dead for
seven days.

Also Varro records that when he was acting as one
