BOOK VI. xxx. 124-xxxl. 126

Nearchus and Onesicritus report that the Euphrates The
is navigable from the Persian Sea to Babylon, a mmmm,
distance of 412 miles; but subsequent writers say
it is navigable up to Seleucia, 440 miles, and Juba
from Babylon as far as Charax, 175} miles. Some
report that it continues to {low in a single charmel
for a distance of 87 miles beyond Babylon before it is
diverted into irrigation-channels, and that its entire
course is 1200 miles long. This discrepancy of
measurement is due to the variety of authors that
have dealt with the matter, as even among the
Persians different writers give different measurements
for the length of the schoenusa and the parasang.
Where it ceases to afford protection by its channeL
as it does when its course approaches the boundary
of Charax, it immediately begins to be infested by
the Attali, an Arabian tribe of brigands, beyond
whom are the Scenitae. But the winding course
of the Euphrates is occupied by the Nomads of
Arabia right on to the desert of Syria, where, as we
have stated, the river makes a bend to the south, V. 87.
quitting the um'nhabited districts of Palmyra. The
distance of Seleucia from the beginning of Mesopo-
tamia is a voyage by the Euphrates of 1125 miles ; its
distance from the Red Sca, if the voyage by made by
the Tigris, is 320 miles, and from Bridgetown 724
miles. Bridgetown is 175 miles from Seleucia on
the Mediterranean coast of Syria. This gives the
breadtli of the country lying between the Mediter-
ranean and the Red Sea.1> The extent of the kingdom
of Parthia is 918 miles.

confluence with the Euphrates, the name of which
