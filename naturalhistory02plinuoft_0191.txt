The fourth of the great Gulfs of Europe begins at Black Sea.
the Dardanelles and ends at the entrance of the Sea
of Azov. But in order more easily to indicate the
divisions of the Black Sea we must give a brief
description of its shape as a whole. It is a vast body
of water lying in front of Asia and shut out from
Europe by the promontory of Gallipoli; but it forces
an entrance into the interior by a narrow winding-
charmel, and separates Europe from Asia, as has been
said, by a strait that is less than a mile wide. The 249.
first part of the narrows is called the Dardanelles3
here the Persian king Xerxes made the bridge of
boats across which he led his army. From there a
narrow channel 86 miles long extends to the Asiatic
city of Priapus; it was here that Alexander the
Great crossed. From this point the water begins to
widen out, and afterwards narrows again. The wide
part is called the Sea of Marmara and the narrows
the Straits of Constantinople3 at the point where
Xerxes’ father Darius conveyed his forces across by
means of a bridge itis 500 yards wide, and its entire
length from the Dardanelles is 239 miles.

Then comes the vast extent of the Black Sea,
formerly the Axenus,a which cncroaches on a large
area of the continent, and with a great bend of its
coasts curves back into horns and from them strctchcs
out on either side, producing exactly the shape of a
Scythian bowst In the middle of the curve it is
joined by the mouth of the Sea of Azov; this aperture
is called the Straits of Kertseh‚ and measurcs two and
a half miles across. The distance in a straight line
