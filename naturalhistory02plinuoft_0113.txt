Italy. Τῆθ distance across from Ancona to Pola
is 120 miles.

In the interior of the tenth region are the colonies
of Cremona and Brescia in the territory of the
Cenomani, and Este in that of the Veneti, and the
towns of Asolo, padua, Oderzo, Belluno, Vicenza
and Mantua, the only remaining Tuscan town across
the Po. According to Cato, the Veneti are deseended
from a Trojan stock, and the Cenomani lived among
the Volcae in the neighbourhood of Marseilles.
There are also the Rhaetic towns of Feltre, Trent
and Berua, Verona which belongs to the Rhaeti and
Euganei jointly, and Zuglio which belongs to the
Carni; then peoples that we need not be concerned
to designate with more particularity‚the Alutrenses,
Asseriates, Flamonienses α Vanienses and other
Flamonienses surnamed Curici, the Forojuliensesb
surnamed Transpadani, Foretani‚ Nedinates,⁶ Quar-
queni,d Tan-isani,e Togienses, Varvari. In this district
there have disappeared‚ on the coast-line, Irmene,
Pellaon, Palsicium‚ Atina and Caelina belonging
to the Veneti, Segesta and Ocra to the Carni,
Noreia to the Taurisci. Also Lucius Piso states
that a town 12 miles from Aquileia was destroyed
by Marcus Claudius Marcellus, although against
the wish of the Senate.

This region also contains eleven famous lakes and
the rivers of which they are the source, or which,
in the case of those that after entering the lakes
leave them again, are augmented by them—for
instance the Adda that flows through Lake Como,
the Ticino through Maggiore, the Mincio through
Garda, the Seo through the Lago di Seo, and the
