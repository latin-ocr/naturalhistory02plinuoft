Stratos, and Argos surnamcd Amphilochian, and the
river Achelous flowing from Mount Pindus and
separating Acarnania from Aetolia; the continual
deposits of earth that it brings down are linking the
island of Artemita to the main land.

ΙΙ. The Aetolian peoples are the Athamanes, North sta·
Tymphaei, Ephyri, Aenienses, Perrhaebi, Dolopes, {fg-¹222&
Maraces and Atraces in whose district is the source
of the river Atrax that flows into the Ionian Sea.
The towns of Aetolia are Calydon on the river Evenus
seven miles and a halffrom the sea, and then Macynia
and Molycria, behind which are Mount Chalcis and
Taphiassus. On the coast is the Promontory of
Antirrhium, at which is the mouth of the Gulf of
Corinth, less than a mile broad, whose channe]
separates the Aetolians from the Morea. The
promontory that juts out opposite is called Rhium.
Aetolian towns on the Gulf of Corinth are Lepanto,
Eupalimna, and inland Pleuron and Halicarna.
Notable mountains are Tomarus in the district of
Dodona, Crania in Ambracia, Aracynthus in Acarn-
ania, and Achaton, Panaetolium and Macynium in
Aetolia.

III. Next to the Aetolians are the Locrians, sur-
named Ozolae,⁶ who are exempt from tribute. Here
are the town of Oeanthe, the harbour of Apollo
Phaestius and the gulf of Salona3 and inland the
towns of Argyna, Eupalia, Phaestum and Calamisus.
Beyond are the Cirrhaean Plains of Phocis, the town
of Cirrha and the port of Chalaeon, seven miles inland
from which is Delphi, a frec town at the foot of Mount
Parnassus and the seat of the oracle of Apollo, the
most famous in the world. Here are the Castalian
Spring and the river Cephisus flowing past Delphi;
