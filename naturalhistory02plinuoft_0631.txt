116 years can be exceeded. Also the theory handed
doxm by Petosiris and Necepsos is still extant (it is
called the Theory of Quarters, from its dividjng up
the Zodjac into groups of three signs); this theory
shows it possible to attain 124 years of life in the
region of Italy. These thinkers declared that
nobody exceeds the ascendant measure of 90 degrees
(what is called ‘ risings ⁷), and stated that this period
itself may be cut short by the encounter of male-
ficent stars, or even by their rays and by those of
the sun. Again it is uncertain what is the greatest
longevity allowed by the school of Aesculapius,
which says that fixed periods of life are received from
the stars; however, they say that longer period<
of life are rare, inasmuch as vast crowds of men are
born at critical moments in the hours of the lunar
days, for example the 7th and the 15th hour counting

records: we will only produce cases from the middle
region between the Apennines and the Po. Three
persons declared 120 years at Parma and one at
Brescello; two at Parma 1253 one man at Piaccnza
