one and a half times the size of Asia, and two and
one sixth times the width of Africa. Combining
all these figures together, it will be clearly manifest

XXXIX. To these we shall further add one

theory of Greek discovery showing the most re· ,s

condite ingenujty, so that nothing may be wanting
in our survey of the geography of the world, and so
that now the various regions have been indicated,
it may be also learnt what alliance or relationship
of days and nights each of the regions has, and in
which of them the shadows are of the same length
and the world’s convexity is equal. An account will
therefore be given of this also, and the whole earth
will be mapped out in accordance with the consti-
tuent parts of the heavens.

The world has a number of segments to which
our countrymen give the name of ¹ eircles ’ and which
the Greeks call ¹ parallels ’. The first place belongs
to the southward part of India, extending as far as
Arabia and the people inhabiting the coast of the
Red Sea. This segment includes the Gedrosians,
Carmanians, Per-siam, and Elyrnaeans‚ Parthyene,
Aria, Susiane, Mesopotamia, Babylonian Seleucia,
Arabia as far as Petra, Hollow Syria, Pelusium,
the lower parts of Egypt called Chora, Alexandria,
the coastal parts of Africa, all the towns of Cyrenaica,
Thapsus, Hadrumetum, Clupea, Carthage‚ Utica,

the Atlantic Ocean, the Straits of Gibraltar. In
this latitude, at noon at the time of the equinox a

not more than 4 ft. long, while the longest night
