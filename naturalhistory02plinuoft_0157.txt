BOOK IV. vm. 29-31

Larisa, Gomphi, Thessalian Thebes, Elm Wood, the
Gulf of Volo, the town of Pagasa subsequently
called Demetrias, Tricca, the Pharsalian Plains with
their free city, Crannon, Iletia. The mountains of
Phthiotis are Nymphaeus, once so beautiful for its
naturallandscapeb ‹rardening‚ Buzvgaeus, Donacoessa,
Bromiaeus, Daphusa, Chimarone, Athamas, Ste-
phane. In 'lhessaly there aie 34, of which the most
famous are Cercetii, Pierian Olympus and Ossa, facing
which are Pindus and Othr3s the abode of the Lapi-
thae—these looking to the u est· , and looking east is
Peli0n3 all form a curve like a theatre, and in the
hollow in front of them lie 75 cities. Thessaly
contains the rivers Apidanus, Phoenix, Enipeus,
Onochonus and Pamisus3 the spring Messeis3 Lake
Boebeis; and before all alike in celebrity the river
Peneus, rising close to Gomphi and flowing down a
wooded glen between Ossa and Olympus for 62}
miles, for half of which distance it is navigable. Part
of this course is called the Vale of Tempe, 5 miles
long and nearly an acre and a halfa in breadth,with
gently sloping hills rising beyond human sight on
either hand, while the valley between is verdant with
a grove oftrees. Along it glides the Peneus, glittering
with pebbles and adorned with grassy banks, melodi-
ous with the choral song of birds. Into it flows the
river Orcus, to which it gives no intimate welcome,
but merely carries it for a brief space floating on its
sui-face like a skin of oil, in Homer's phrase, ὁ and then

οὐδό γε Πηνειῷ συμ μ ι’σγεται ἀργυροδίνῃ
ἀλλά τέ μιν καθύπε ςῚρθενε επι ρρέει ἠύτ’ ἔλαι ι·ον
ὅρκον γὰρ δει νῦο Στυγὸςυ ὕδατός’ εστιν ἀπορρώξ.

Homer' s ὅρκον, ‘a thing to swear by,’ is read by Pliny aa a
proper name.
