Medes and the Adiabeni above Paraetacene and
Farsistan. The distance of Chalonitis from Farsistan
is 380 miles, and some persons say that by the shortest
route it is the same distance from the Caspian Sea
and from Syria. Between these races and Mesene
is Sittacene, which is also called Arbelitis and
Palaestine. Its town of Sittace is of Greek origin,
and also to the east of this is Sabdata and to the
west Antiochia, which lies between the two rivers,
Tigris and Tornadotus, and also Apamea, which
Antiochus named after his mother; this town is

it. Below is Susiane, in which is situated Susa, the

Darius son of Hystaspes. Babylonia is 450 miles
from Seleucia, and the same distance from Ecbatana

Susa is a village on the Chaldaic ὲ313156 called Aple,
the distance of which from Susa is a voyage of 621

to the north is Massabatene, lying below Mount
