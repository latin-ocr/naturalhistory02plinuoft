of philosophy was sent from Athens,“ after hearing
Carneades advised that these envoys should be sent
away as soon as possible, because when Carneades

The Cato in question always on other occasions
recommended the total banishment of Greeks from

be read above his last ashes together xm'th the
memorial of a poet. His late Majesty Augustus
overrode the modesty of Virgil’s will and forbade
the burning of his poems‚ and thus the bard achieved

own works himself. In the library founded at Rome
by Asinius Pollio, the earliest library in the world
established out of the spoils of war, the only statue
of a living person erected was that of Marcus Varro,

the Great gave to that same Varro a naval crown
for his conduct in the war with the pirates. There
