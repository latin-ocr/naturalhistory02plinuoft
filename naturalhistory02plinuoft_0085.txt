Aegusa)‚ Levanzo‚ Alicus (75 miles from Solunto),
and Ustica opposite to Pan-opus. On the Italian
side of Sicily facing the river Metaurus, at a distance
of nearly 25 miles from Italy, are the seven islands
called the Aeolian and also the Liparean: their
Greek name is the Hephaestiades, and the Roman
Vulcan's Islands; they are called Aeolian from King
Aeolus who reigned there in the Homeric period.

IX. Lipari, with a town possessing rights of Roman
citizenship, takes its name from King Liparus‚ who
succeeded Aeolus—it was previously called Milo-
gonis or Meligunis; it is 25 miles from Italy, and its
circumference measures a little less than 5 miles.
Between it and Sicily is another island formerly
called Therasia, and now Holy Islanda because it is
sacred to Vulcan, on it being a hill that vomits out
flames in the night. The third island is Stromboli, six
miles to the east of Lipari3 here Aeolus reigned.
It differs from Lipari only in the fact that its flame
is more liquid3 the local population are reported
to be able to foretell from its smoke three days
abead what winds are going to blow, and this is the
source of the belief that the winds obeyed the orders
of Aeolus. The fourth of the islands, Didyme, is
smaller than Lipari. The fifth, Eriphusa, and the
sixth‚ Phoenicusa, are left to provide pasture for the
flocks of the neighbouring isla11ds3 the last and also
the smallest is Euonymus. So far as to the first
gulf of Europe.

X. At Locri begins the projection of Italy called
Magna Graecia, retiring into the three bays of the
Ausonian Sea, so called from its first inhabitants the
Ausones. According to Varro its length is 86 miles,
but most authorities have made it 75. On this
