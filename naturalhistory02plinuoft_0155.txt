BOOK IV. vn. 27-vx11. 29

The only town of Phocis on the coast is Daphnus,
but inland are Larisa, Elatea, and on the banks of the
Cephisus, as we have said, Lilaea, and, facing Delphi,
Cnemis and Hyampolis. Then there is the Locrian
coast, on which are Larumna and Thronium, near
which the river Boagrius flows into the sea, and the
towns of Narycum, Alope and Scarphia. Afterwards
comes the Malian Gulf‘² named from its inhabitants
and on it are the towns of Halcyone, Aeconia and
Phalara.

Then comes Doris, in which are Sperchios, Erineon,
Boion, Pindus and Cytinum. In the rear of Doris is
Mount Oeta.

There follows Haemonia, which has often changed
its name, having been successively called Pelasgis
or Pelasgic Argos, and Hellas, Thessaly and Dryopis,
always taking its surname from its kings: it was
the birthplace of the king named Graecus from
whom Greece is named, and of king Hellen from
whom the Hellenes get their name. These same
people are called by three different names in Homer,
Myrmidons, Hellenes and Achaeans. The section of
the Hellenos adjacent to Doris are named Phthiotae3
their towns are Akhino and Heraclea, which takes
the name of Trechinb from the Pass of Thermo-

notable towns are Hellas, Halos, Lamia, Phthia and
Arne.

VIII. The places in Thessaly are Orchomenus, Thes-wlv-
formerly called the Minyan‚ and the town of Alimon,
otherwise Holmon, Atrax, Palamna, the Hyperian
Spring‚ the towns of Pherae (behind which lies
Pieria spreading in the direction of Macedonia),
