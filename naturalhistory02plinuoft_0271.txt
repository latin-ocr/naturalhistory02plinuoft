pieee of land shaped like a triangle3 and conse-
quently many have called Egypt by the name of
the Greek letter Delta. The distance from the
point where the single channe] first splits into
branches to the Canopic mouth is 146 miles and to
the Pelusiae mouth 156 miles.

The uppermost part of Egypt, marching with
Ethiopia‚ is called the Thebaid. It is divided into
prefectures of towns, called ‘ nomes '—the Ombite,
Apollonopolite, Hermonthite, Thinite, Phaturite‚
Coptite, Tentyrite‚ Diospolite, Antaeopolite‚ Aphro-
ditopolite and Lycopolite nomes. The nomes be-
longing to the district in the neighbourhood of Pelu-
sium are the Pharbaethite‚ Bubastite, Sethroite and
Tanite. The remaining nomes are called the Arabie,
Hammoniae (on the way to the oracle of Jupiter
Ammon), Oxyrhynchste, Leontopolite, Athribite,
Cynopolite‚ Hermopolite‚ Xoite, Mendesian‚ Seben-
nyte, Cabasite, Latopolite, Heliopolite, Prosopste,
Panopolite, Busirite, Onuphite‚ Saite, Ptenethus,
Ptemphus, Naucratite, Metellite, Gynaecopolite‚
Menelaite-——these forming the region of Alexandria;
and likeudse Mareotis belonging to Libya. The
Heracleopolite nome is on an island of the Nile
measuring 50 miles long, on which is also the town
called the City of Hercules. There are two nomes
called the Arsinoite3 these and the Memphite ex-
tend to the apex of the Delta, adjacent to which
on the side of Africa are the two Oasite nomes.
Certain authorities alter some out of these names
and substitute other nomes, for instance the Hero-
polite and Crocodilopolite. Between the Arsinoite
and Memphite nomes there was once a lake
measuring 250, or according to Mucianus’s account
