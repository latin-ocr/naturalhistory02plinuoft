lakes drain into the river Nera, which from these
derives the river Tiber with its sulphurous waters,
and they are replenished by the Avens which runs
down from Monte Fiscello near the Groves of
Vacuna and Rieti and loses itself in the lakes in
question. In another direction the Teverone rising
in Mount Trevi drains into the Tiber three lakes
famous for their beauty‚ from which Subiaco takes its
name. In the district of Rieti is the lake of Cutilia,
which is said by Marcus Varro to be the central
point of Italy, and to contain a floating island.
Below the Sabine territory lies Latium, on one side
of it Picenum, and behind it Umbria, while the
ranges of the Apennines fence it in on either side.

XIII. The fifth region is that of Picenum, which
formerly was very densely populated: 360,000
Picentines took the oath of allegiance to Rome.‹²
They derived their origin from the Sabines, who had
made a vow to celebrate a Holy SpringJ’ The
territory that they took possession of began at the
river Aterno, where are now the district and colony
of Adria, 6 miles from the sea. Here is the river
Vomanus, the territories of Praetutia and Palma,
also the New Camp, the river Batinus, Tronto with
its river, the only Liburnian settlemcnt left in Italy,
the river Albula, Tessuinum, and Helvinum where
the region of the Praetutii ends and that of Picenum
begins; the town of Cupra, Porto di Fermo, and
above it the colony of Ascoli, the most famous in
Picenum. Inland is Novana, and on the coast Cluana,
Potentia, Numana founded by the Sicilians, and
Ancona, a colony founded by the same people on the
promontory of Cunerus just at the elbow of the coast
where it bends round, 183 miles from Monte Gargano.
