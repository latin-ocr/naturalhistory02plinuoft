nearest to Ravenna forms the large basin called the
Harbour of the Santern03 it was here that Claudius
Caesar sailed out into the Adriatic, in what was a
vast palace rather than a ship, when celebrating his
triumph over Britain. This mouth was formerly
called the Eridanus, and by others the Spineticus
from the city of Spina that formerly stood near it,
and that was believed on the evidence of its treasures
deposited at Delphi to have been a very powerful

territory of Cornelius Market.

The next mouth to this is the Caprasian mouth,
then that of Sagis, and then Volane, formerly called
Olane ; all of these form the Flavian Canal, which was
first made from the Sagis by the Tuscans, thus dis-
charging the flow of the river across into the marshes
of the Atriani called the Seven Seas, with the famous
harbour of the Tuscan town of Atria which formerly
gave the name of Atriatic to the sea now called the
Adriatic. Next come the deep-water mouths of
Carbonaria and the Fosses of Philistina, called by
others Tartarus, all of which originate from the
overflow of the Philistina Canal, with the addition
of the Adige from the Trentino Alps and of the
Bacchiglione from the district of Padua. A part of
these streams also forms the neighbouring harbour
of Brondolo, as likewise that of Chioggia is formed

With these streams the Po unites and flows through
them into the sea, according to most authorities

of a triangle, like what is called the Delta formed
