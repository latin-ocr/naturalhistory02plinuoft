BOOK VII. mr. 214

Catania in Sicily had been taken ‘² by the consul Manius
Valerius Messala, and that it was brought from Sicily
thirty years later than the traditional date of Papi-
rius’s sundial‚ B.C. 264. The lines of this sundial did
not agree with the honrs, but all the same they
followed it for 99 years, till Quintus Marcius Philippus
who was Censor with Lucius Paulus placed a more
carefully designed one next to it, and this gift was
received as one of the most welcome of the censor’s
undertakings. Even then however the hours were
uncertain in cloudy weather, until the next lustrum,
when Scipio Nasica the colleague of Laenas instituted
the first w ater· clock dividing othe hours of the nights
and the days equally, and dedic· lied this time- -piece in
a roofed bussding, B. e. 159 For so long a period the
divisions of daylight had not been marked for the
Roman public.

We will now turn to the rest of the animals‚
beginning with land-animals.
