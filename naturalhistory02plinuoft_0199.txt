Bey ond is the river Somara, which forms the
boundary between the Nomad and Agricultural
tribes, and then the Acesinus. Some authorities
say that below Olbia the Somara flows into the
Dnieper, but the more accurate make the Bug a
tributary of the Dnieper—so erroneous it is to put
the latter in a region of Asia.

Here the sea runs in, forming a large gulf, until outso
there is only a space of five miles separating it from ΜΨ ⁰
the Sea of Azov, and it forms the coastline of vast
tracts of land and numerous races; this is called the
Gulf of Negropoli.a Here is the river Pacyris, the
towns of Navarum and Carcine, and behind them
Lake Buces, which discharges into the sea by an
artificial channel. Lake Buces itself is shut off by
a rocky ridge from the Bay of Coretus in the Sea
of Azov. Into it run the rivers Buces, Gerrhus
and Bug, coming from different directions: for the
Gerrhus separates the Nomads and the Basilides,
while the Bug flows through the Nomads and
Foresters and discharges byU an artificially made
channel into the Buces and by a natural channel into
the Coretus: this region has the name of Scythia
Sindica.

At the river Carcinites begins the Crimea, itself Crimea,
also formerly surrounded by the sea where there are
now low- -lying stretches of land, though afterwards
it rises in huge mountain ridges. The population
includes 30 tribes; of these 23 live in the interior,
6 towns are occupied by the Orgocyni, Characeni,
Assyrani, Stactari, Acisalitae and Caliordi, and the
Scythotauri ὸ occupy the actual ridge. On the west
side they are adjoined by the New Peninsula and on
