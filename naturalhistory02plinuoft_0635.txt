slumber, everybody is alive for only a half of his
life, whereas an equal portion is passed in a manner
that resembles death, or, in default of slumber,
torture. And we are not counting in the years of
infancy that lack sensation, nor those of old age that
remains alive to be tormented‚ nor all the kinds of
dangers, all the diseases, all the fears, all the anxieties,
with death so often invoked that this is the commonest

least susceptible to plague. For diseases attack not
only entire nations but also particular classes, some-
times the slaves, sometimes the nobility, and so
through other grades. In this respect it has been
