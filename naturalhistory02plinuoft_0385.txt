Caucasus range. Greater Armenia, which occupies
the fi ont of the mountain sloping tou ards Comma-
gene, is adjoined, as we have said, by Cephenia, §28-
which lies on the descent on both sides of it, and this
by Adiabene, where the land of the Ass3 rians begins3
the part of Adiabene nearest to Syria is Arbilitis,
where Alexander conquered Darius. The Mace-
domins have given to the whole of Adiabene the
name of ΝΙ) gdonia, from its likcness to My2²> odonia' in
Macedon. Its tow ns are Alexandria and Antiochia,
the native name for which' is Nesebis3 it is 750 miles
from Artaxata. There κν as also once the town of
Nineveh w hich was on the Tigris facino· west, and was
fomierly very famous. Adjoining the other front of
Greater Armenia, which stretches to the Caspian
Sea, is Atrapatene‚ separated from the district of
Otene in Armenia by the Aras; its chief town is
Gazae, 450 miles from Artaxata and the same
distance from Hamadan‚ the city of the Medes, to
which race the Atrapateni belong.

XVII. Hamadan, the capit-11 of Media, which was Media.
founded b3 Κίησ Seleucus, is 750 miles from Great
Seleucia and 20 miles from the Caspian Gates. The
other towns of Media are Phazaca‚ Aganzaga and
Apamea, called Rhei. The reason for theo name

‘Gates' is the same as that stated abme: thc §aa
range is here pierced by a nari-ow pass 8 miles long⁷
scarcely broad enough for a single line of waggon
traffic, the whole of it a work of engineering. It is
ov erhung on either side by crags that look as if they
had been exposed to the action of fire, the countr3
over a range of 28 miles being· entirely w atcrless;
the narrow passage is impeded by a stieam of salt
water that collects from the rocks and finds an exit
