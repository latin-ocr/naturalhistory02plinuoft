BOOK V. 1x. 50—x. 52

450, miles round, and 250 feet deep, an artificial sheet
of water, called the Lake of Moeris after the king
who made it. Its site is 62 miles from Memphis,
the former citadel of the kings of Egypt, and from
Memphis it is 12 days‘ journey to the Oracle of
Ammon and 15 days' journey to the place where
the Nile divides and forms what we have called the
Delta.

X. The sources from which the Nile rises have
not been ascertained, proceeding as it does through
scorching deserts for an enormously long distance
and only having been explored by unarmed investi-
gators, without the wars that have discovered all
other countries; but so far as King J uba was able
to ascertain‚ it has its origin in a mountain of lower
Mauretania not far from the Ocean, and imme-
diately forms a stagnant lake called Nilides. Fish
found in this lake are the alabeta, coracinus and
silurus3 also a crocodile was brought from it by
Juba to prove his theory, and placed as a votive
offering in the temple of Isis at Caesarea, where it
is on view to-day. Moreover it has been observed
that the Nile rises in proportion to excessive falls of
snow or rain in Mauretania. Issuing from this lake
the river disdains to flow through arid deserts of
sand, and for a distance of several days’ journey it
hides underground, but afterwards it bursts out in
another larger lake in the territory of the Masaesyles
clan of Mauretania Caesariensis, and so to speak
makes a survey of the communities of mankind,
proving its identity by having the same fauna.
Sinking again into the sand of the desert it hides for
another space of 20 days' journey till it reaches the
nearest Ethiopians, and when it has once more

The Nile.
