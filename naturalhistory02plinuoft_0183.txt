their name. The first of these is Andro with a town
of the same name, 10 miles from Mandili and 38 from
Ceos. Myrsilus tells us that Ceos was once called
Cauros, and later Antandros3 Callimachus says it
had the name of Lasia, others Nonagria or Hydrusa or
Epagris. Its circuit measures 93 miles. At a distance
of a mile from Andros and 15 miles from Delos is
Tino, with a city of the same name3 this island is 15
miles in length. Aristotle says that owing to its
abundance of springs it once was called Hydrusa;
others give its old name as Ophiusa. The other
islands are: Mykono, with Mount Two Breasts, 15
miles from Delos; Siphnos, previously called
Meropia and Acis, 28 miles round3 Serpho 15 miles

most famous of the Cyclades and lying in the middle

and for its commerce. According to the story, Delos

island that down to the time of Marcus Varro had
never felt an earthquake shock; Mucianus however
states that it has suffered twice from earthquake.
Aristotle has recorded that it owes its namea to

Celadusa, and also Artemites and Celadine3 Syros,
stated by old writers to measure 20 miles in circuit,
but by Mucianus 160 miles; Olearos; Paros, with
