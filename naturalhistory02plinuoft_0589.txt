BOOK VII. imvm. 101—104

adding Book XVI to his Annals on their account.
Lucius Siccius Dentatus, Tribune of the Plebs in
the consulshipa of Spurius Tarpeius and Aulus
Aternius not long after the expulsion of the kings,
scores an exceedingly lalge number of votes, as
haring fought in 120 battleS, been challenged to
and having& won eight single combats, and having
the distinction of 45 sears in front and none at all
on his back. He also captured spoils 34 times, had
bestowed upon him 18 spear-shafts,²⁷ 25 b1·east-badgeS‚
83 necklets‚ 160 bracelets, 26 crowns (including 14
civic crowns‚ eight of gold, three mural crowns, one
siege-rescuc crowffi), a bag of money, ten prisoners
of war and with them 20 cows3 also he followed
in the triumphs of nine generals whose victories
were chiefly due to his aid, and in addition—and
this in my opinion is his finest achievement—pro-
cured the conviction in the People's Court at the
termination of his consulship of one of his leaders
Titus Romilius on the charge of maladministration
of his office. The military distinctions of Capi-
tolinus ⁶ would be not inferior, if he had not cancelled
them by the conclusion of his career. He had
twice captured enemy 's spoils before he was seven-
teen years old; he had been the first of any one to
receive a mural crovm as a Knight, as well as six
civic crowns and 37 gifts· ‚ he had received 23 wounds
on the front of his body; he had rescued Publius
Servilius Master of the Horse, when himself wounded
in the shoulder and thigh3 above all he had alone
saved the Capitol and the fortunes of the state
therein from the Gauls d—if only he had not saved
it to make himself king.
