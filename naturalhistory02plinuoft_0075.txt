Balearic islands, formidable in warfare with the
sling,‘² have been desi gnated by the Greeks the
Gymnasiae The lalger island, Majorca‚ is 100
miles m length and 475 1n circumfei enee It contains
towns of Roman citizen colonists, P alma and Pollenza,
towns with Latin rights, Sineu and Tueis· ‚ a treaty
town of the Bocchi, no longer existing. The smaller
island, Minorca‚ is 30 miles away from Majorca3
its length is 40 miles and its circumference 150;
it contains the states of Iamo, Sanisera and Port
Mahon. Twelve miles out to sea from Majorca is
Cabrera, treacherous for shipwrecks, and right off
the city of Palma lie the Malgrates and Dragonera
and the small island of El Torre.

The soil of Iviza drives away snakes, but that of
Colubraria breeds snakes, and consequently that
island is dangerous to all people except those who
bring earth from Iviza3 the Greeks called it
Snake Island. Iviza does not breed rabbits either,
which ravage the crops of the Balearics. The sea is
full of shoals, and there are about twenty other small
islands; off the coast of Gaul at the mouth of the
Rhone is Metina, and then the island named Brescon,

of ΝΙει-εείΙΙθε call the Row of Islands because
of their arrangement, their Greek names being
rin-st Island‚ Middle Island‚ also called Pomponiana,
and the third Hypaea; next to these are Iturium,
Phoenica, Lero,⁶ and opposite Antibes Lerina,d
on which according to local tradition there was once
a town called Berconum.
