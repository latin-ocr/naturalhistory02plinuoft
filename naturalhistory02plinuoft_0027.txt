The Guadalquivir rises in the province of Tar-ragom,
not at the town of Mentesa, as some authorities
have said, but in the Tuo-iensian Forest bordered by
the riv er Segura that w atei-s the territory of Carta-
gena3 at Lorea it avoids the Sepolcro de Scipion
and, turning w estw ard, makes for the Atlantic
Ocean, giving its name to the ριονίηοε; it is first
of moderato size, but it receives many tributaries,
from which it takes their glory as well as their waters.
It first enters Baetica at Ossigetanim gliding gently
in a picturesque channe] past a scries of towns situated
on both its banks.

Between this river and the Ocean coast the most
famous places inland are 2 Segida surnamed Augurina 3
Julia or Fidentia3 Urgao or Alba3 Ebura or Cerialis3
Iliberri or Liberini3 Ilipula or Laus3 Artigi or
Julienses3 Vesci or Faventia3 Singili, Ategua,
Arialdunum, Agla Minor, Bachro, Castra Vinaria,
Cisimbrium,New Hippo, IHurco, Osca, Oscua, Sucaelo,
Unditanum, Old Tucci—all of which are places in
that part of Bastetania which stretches towards the
sea. In the jurisdiction of Cordova in the neighbour-
hood of the actual river are Ossigi surnamed La-
tonium, Iliturgi or Forum Julium, Ipra‚ Isturgi or
Triumphale, Sucia, and 17 miles inland Obulco or
Pontificense, then Ripa, Epora (a treaty town),
Sacili Martialium, Onuba, and on the right bank
the colony of Cordova sui-named Patricia. At this
point the Guadalquivir first becomes navigable‚ and
there are the towns ofCarbula and Dctunda, the river
Xenil flowing into the Guadalquivir on the same side.
