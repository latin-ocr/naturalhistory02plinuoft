inhabitants of the other side of this mountain work
a wide range of gold and silver mines. Next to
these come the Oratae, whose king has only ten
elephants but a large force of infantry, the
Suarataratae-—these also though ruled by a king
do not keep elephants but rely on cavalry and
infantry—the Odonbaeoraes and the Arabastrae‚
whose fine city Thorax is guarded by marshy canals
which crocodiles‚ creatures with an insatiable
appetite for human flesh, render impassable save

is also highly spoken of, Automula, which is situated
on the coast at the point of confluence of five rivers,
and has a celebrated market; their king possesses
1600 elephantS, l50‚000 foot and 5000 horse. The
king of the Charmae is not so wealthy, having 60
elephants and small forces of the other kinds. The
race next to these is that of the Pandae, the only
people in India ruled by queens. They say that
only one child of the female sex was born to Hercules,
and that she was in consequence his favourite and
he bestowed on her a specially large kingdom.
The queens deriving their descent from her rule over
300 towns, and have an army of 150‚000 foot and
500 elephants. After this list of 300 cities we have
the Derangae, Posingae, Butae, Gogaraei, Umbrae,
Nereae, Brangosi, Nobundae, Cocondae, Nesei,
Palatitae, Salobriasae and Orostrae, the last people
being adjacent to the island of Patala, the distance
from the extreme point of which to the Caspian
Gates is given as 1925 miles.

From this point onward the tribes dwelling on the
Indus—our enumeration proceeding up stream—
are the Mathoae, Bolingae, Gallitalutae, Dimuri,
