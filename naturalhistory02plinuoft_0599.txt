is a countless series of Roman examples, if one chose
to pursue them, since a single racc has produced
more men of distinction in every branch whatever
than the whole of the other countries. But what
excuse could Ι have for omitting mention of you,
Marcus Tullius? or by what distinctive mark can I
advertise your superlative excellence? by what in
preference to the most honourable testimony of that
whole nation’s decree‚ selecting out of your entire
life only the achievements of your consulship?⁰
Your oratory induced the tribes to discard the
agrarian law‚‘> that is, their own livelihood; your
advice led them to forgive Roscius ⁶ the proposer of
the law as to the thcatre, and to tolerate with
equanimity the mark put upon them by a distinc-
tion of seating; your entreaty made the children of
‘the men sentenced to proscription ashamed to stand
for office3 your genius drove Catiline to flight3 you
proscribed Mark Antony. Hail, first recipient of
the title of Father of the Country, first winner of a
civilian triumph and of a wreath of honour for
oratory, and parent of eloquence and of Latium's
letters 3 and (as your former foe, the dictator Caesar,
wrote of you) winner of a greater laurel wreath than
that of any triumph, inasmuch as it is a greater
thing to have advanced so far the frontiers of
the Roman genius than the frontiers of Rome’s

empire.
