island reached, a town of the Semberritae, gov-
erned by a queen, and another town named Asara;
on the second island, the town of Darde; the third
island is called Medo& and the town on it is Asel3
the fourth is Garroe, with a town of the same name.
Then along the banks are the towns ofNautis, Machina,
Demadatis,‘² Secande, Navectabe with the territory
of Psegipta, Candragori, Araba, Summara. Above
is the region of Sirbitum, where the mountain range
ends, and which is stated by some writers to be
occupied by Ethiopian coast-tribes, the Nisicathae
and Nisitae‚ names that mean ‘ men with three'
or ‘with four eyes '—not because they really are
like that but because they have a particularly keen
sight in using arrows. On the side of the Nile that
stretches inland from the Greater Syrtes and the south-
ern ocean Dalion says there are the Vacathi, who use
only rain-water, the Cisori, the Logonpori five days’
journey from the Oecalices, the Usibalchi‚ Isbeli,
Perusii‚ Ballii and Cispii; and that all the rest of the
country is uninhabited. Then come regions that are
purely imaginary: towards the west are the Nigroi,
whose king is said to have only one eye, in his fore-
head; the VVild-beast-eaters, who live chiefly on the
flesh of panthers and lions; the Eatalls, who devour
everything3 the Man-eaters, whose diet is human
flesh; the Dog-milkers‚ who have dogs’ heads; the
Artabatitae,⁶ who have four legs and rove about
like wild animals; and then the Hesperioi, the
Perorsi and the people we have mentioned as in- v. 10.
habiting the border of Mauretania. One section of
the Ethiopians live only on locusts, dried in snioke
and salted to keep for a year’s supply of food3
these people do not live beyond the age of forty.
