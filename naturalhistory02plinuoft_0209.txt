BOOK IV. xm. 94—96

Mountains α must coast to the left along the shore of
the northern ocean until we reaeh Cadiz. In this
direction a number of islands ὁ are reported to exist
that have no names, but according to the account of
Timaeus there is one named Baunonia,0 lying off
Scythia, at a distance of a day’s voyage from the
coast, on the beach of which in spring time amber is
east up by the waves. The rest of these coasts are
only known in detail by reports of doubtful authority.
To the north is the ocean; beyond the river Para—
panisus where it washes the coast of Scythia Heca-
taeus calls it the Amalchian Sea, a name that in the
language of the natives means ‘frozen ’3 Philemon
says that the Cimbrian name for it is Morimarusa
(that is, ‘ Dead Sea ') from the Parapanisus to Cape
Rusbeae, and from that point onward the Cronian
Sea. Xenophon of Lampsacus reports that three
days’ sail from the Scythian coast there is an island
of enormous size called Balcia 3 Pytheas gives its name
as Basilia. Also some islands called the Oeonae are
reported of which the inhabitants live on birds'
eggs and oats‚ and others on which people are born
with horses' feet, which gives them their Greek
name; there are others called the All-ears Islands in
which the natives have very large ears covering the
whole of their bodies, which are otherwise left naked.

From this point more definite information begins
to open up, beginning with the race ofthe Inguaeones‚
the first that we come to in Germany. Here there
is an enormous mountain, the Saevo, as big as those
of the Ripaean range, which forms an enm-mous
bay reaching to the Cimbrian promontory; it is
named the Codanian Gulf, and is studded with islands.
The most famous of these is Scandinavia3 its size
