LIX. The next agreement between nations was in
the matter of shaving the beard, but with the Romans
this was later. Barbers came to Rome from Sicily in

Publius Titinius Mena3 before then the Romans had
been unshaved. The second Africanus first intro-
duced a daily shave. His late Majesty Augustus
never neglected the razor.

LX. The third agreement was in the observation
of the hours (this now being an addition made by
theory) ‚⁰ the date and inventor of which we have stated
in Book II.⁶ This also happened later at Rome: in
the Twelve Tables only sunrise and sunset are
specified; a few years later noon was also added,
the consuls’ apparitor announcing it when from the
Senate—house he saw the sun between the Beaks and
the Greek Lodging. When the sun sloped from the
Maenian Column to the Prison he announced the last
hour, but this only on clear days, down to the First
Punic WVar. We have it on the authority of Fabius
Vestalis that the first sundial was erected 11 years

Quirinus by Lucius Papirius Cursor when dedicating
that temple, which had been vowed by his father;
but Fabius does not indicate the principle of the sun-
dial's construction or the maker, nor where it was
brought from or the name of the writer who is his
authority for the statement. Marcus Varro records
that the first public sun-dial was set up on a column
