XLVII. By the command of the same oracle and
with the assent of Jupiter the supreme deity,
Euthymus the boxer, who won all his matches at
Olympia and was only once beaten, was made a
saint in his lifetime and to his own knowledge. His

of Cyprus, and 200 to Aegimius. Theopompus gives
157 to Epimenides of Cnossus. Hellanicus says that
some members of the clan of the Epii in Aetolia
complete 200 years, and he is supported by Damastes
who records that one of them, Pictoreus, a man of
outstanding stature and strength, even lived 300
years ; Ephorus records Arcadian kings of 300 years;
