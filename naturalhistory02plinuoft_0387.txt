by the same way. Moreover the number of snakes
renders the route impracticable except in winter.

J oining on to the Adiabeni are the people formerly
called the Carduchi and now the Cordueni, past whom
flows the river TigriS, and adjoining these are the
¹ Roadside ¹ Pratitae, as they are called, who hold
the Caspian Gates. Running up to these on the other
side are the Parthian deserts and the Citheni range3
and then comes the very agreeable locality, also
belonging to Parthia, called Choara. Here are the
two Parthian towns formerly serving for protection
against the Medos, Calliope and, on another rock,
Issatis3 but the actual capital of Parthia, Heca-
tompylos, is 133 miles from the Gates——so effectively
is the Parthian kingdom also shut off by passes.
Going out of the Gates one comes at once to the
Caspian nation, which extends down to the coast:
it is from this people that the pass and the sea obtain
their name. On the left there is a mountainous
district. Turning back from this people to the river
Kur the distance is said to be 225 miles, and going
up from the river Kur to the Gatcs 700 miles; for
in the Itineraries of Alexander thc Great this pass is
made the turning-point of his expeditions‚ the distance
from these Gates to the frontier of India being given
as 1961 miles, from thc fronticr to the town of Balkh‚
which is the name given to Za1·iasta,‘¹ 462 milcs, and
from Zariasta to the river Syr Darya 620 miles.

region called Apavortene, in which is Dareium, a A„ am

place noted for its fertility. Then there are the
tribes of the Tapyri, Anariaci, Staures and Hyrcani,
from whose shores the Caspian beyond the river
Sideris begins to be called the Hyrcanian Sea;
