BOOK V

I. Tm: Greeks give to Africa the name of Libya,
and they call the sea lying in front of it the Libyan
Sea. It is bounded by Egypt. No other part of
the earth has fewer bays or inlets in its coast, which
stretches in a long slanting line from the west. The
names of its peoples and towns are absolutely un-
pronounceable except by the natives3 and for the
rest, they mostly reside in fortresses.

The list of its countries begins with the two called
Mauretania, which down to the time of the emperor
Caligula were kingdoms, but by his cruelty were
divided into two provinces. The outermost promon-
tory projecting into the ocean is named by the
Greeks Ampelusia.⁰ Beyond the Straits of Gibraltar
there were once the towns of Lissa and Cotte3 but
at the present day there is only Tangier, which
was originally founded by Antaeus and subsequently
entitled Traducta Juliab by the emperor Claudius
when he established a colony there. It is 30 miles
distant from the town of Baelon in Baetica, where
the passage across is shortest. On the Atlantic
coast 25 miles from Tangier is Julia Constantia
Zulil‚c a colony of Augustus, which is exempt from
the government of the native kings and included
under the jurisdiction of Baetica. Thirty-five miles
from Zulil is Lixus, made a colony by the emperor
