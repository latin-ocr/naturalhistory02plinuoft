multitude of wild beasts, and further inland desolate
haunts of elephants, and then a vast desert, and
beyond it the Garamantes ‘² tribe, at a distance of
twelve days’ journey from Aujelah. Beyond these
was formerly the Psylli tribe, and beyond them
Lake Lynxama‚ surrounded by desert. Aujelah
itself is situated almost in the middle, at an equal
distance on either side from the Ethiopia that
stretches westward and from the region lying between
the two Syrtes. But by the coast between the two
Syrtes it is 250 miles; here are the independent
city of Oea, the river Cinyps and the district of that
name, the towns of Neapolis, Taphra, Habrotonum
and the second Leptis, called Great Leptis. Then
comes the Greater Syrtis, measuring 625 miles
round and 312 wide at the entrance, near which
dwells the race of the Cisippades. At the end of
this Gulf was once the Coast of the Lotus-eaters‚
the people called by some the Machroae, extending
to the Altars of the Philaeni--these are formed of
hcaps of sand. After these, not far from the shore
of the mainland, there is a vast swamp into which
flows the river Tritonis, the name of which it bears;
Callimachus calls it the Lake of Pallas.1> He places
it on the nearer side of the Lesser SyrtiS, but many
writers put it between the two Syrtes. The promon-
tory shutting in the Greater Syrtis is called Cape
Trajun13 beyond it is the province of Cyrene.
Between the rives· Ampsaga and this boundary
Africa contains 516 peoples that accept allegiance
to Rome. These include six colonies, Uthina and
Thuburbi, in addition to those already mentioned3 §§ 22. 2⁴-
15 towns with Roman citizenship, among which in
the interior must be mentioned those of Absurae,
