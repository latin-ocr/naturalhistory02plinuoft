also given the length of the route from the Straits
of Sicily to Alexandria as 1350 miles. The whole
length of the coastline round the bays specified‚
starting at the same point and ending at the Sea of
Azov, amounts to 15‚509 miles—although Artemidorus
puts it at 756 miles more, and also reports that the
total coastline including the shores of Azov measures
17‚390 miles.

This is the measurement made by persons throwing
out a challenge to Fortune not by force of arms, but
by the boldness they have displayed in time of

eace.

p We will now compare the dimensions of particular Dimensions

that will arise from the discrepancy of the ac-
counts given by authors; nevcrtheless the matter
will be most suitably presented by giving the
breadth in addition to the length.⁰ The following,
then, is the formula for the area of Europe . . .
length ὓ 8148 miles. As for Africa—to take the
average of all the various accounts given of its
dimensions—its length works out at 3798 miles, and
the breadth of the inhabited portions nowhere
exceeds 750 miles; but as Agrippa made it 910
miles at the Cyrenaic part of the country, by in-
cluding the African desert as far as the country of
the Garamantes, the extent then known, the entire
length that will come into the calculation amounts
to 4708 miles. The length of Asia is admittedly
6375 miles, and the breadth should properly be
calculated from the Ethiopic Sea to Alexandria on
the Nile, making the measurement run through
Meroe and Syene, which gives 1875 miles. It is
consequently clear that Europe is a little less than
