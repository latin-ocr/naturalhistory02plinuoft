Τὴθ length of the whole of the territory of the
Ethiopians including the Red Sea was estimated by
Agrippa as 2170(ι miles and its breadth including
Upper Egypt 1296 miles. Some authors give the
following divisions of its length: from Meroe to
Sirbitus 12 days' sail, from Sirbitus to the Dabelli 12
days' sail, and from the Dabelli to the Ethiopic Oeean
6 days' journey by land. But authorities are virtually
agreed that the whole distance from the ocean to
Meroe is 625 miles and that the distance from

Meroe to Syene is what we have stated above. The 5184.

conformation of Ethiopia spreads from south-east to
south-west with its centre line running southst It
has flourishing forests, mostly of ebony trees.
Rising from the sea at the middle of the coast is a
mountain⁰ of great height which glows with eternal
fires-—its Greek name is the Chariot of the Gods3
and four days' voyage from it is the cape called the
Horn of the west, on the confines of Africa, adjacent
to the western Ethiopians. Some authorities also
report hills of moderate height in this region, clad
with agreeable shady thickets and belonging to the
Goat-Pans and Satyrs.

XXXVI. It is stated by Ephorus, and also by
Eudoxus and Timosthenes, that there are a large
number of islands scattercd over the whole of the
Eastern Sea3 while Clitarchus says that King
Alexander received a report of one that was so
wealthy that its inhabitants gave a ’calent of gold for
a horse, and of another on which a holy mountain had
been found, covered with a dense forest of trees
from which fell drops of moisture having a marvel-
lously agreeable scent. An island opposite thc
Persian Gulf and lying off Ethiopia is named Cerne3
