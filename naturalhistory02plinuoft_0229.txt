according to Polybius’s account measuring 12 miles
in length and 3 miles in breadth. Its distance from
the mainland at the nearest point is less than 233
yards. but at other places it is more than 7 miles;
the circuit of the island is 15 miles. It has a town
whose population have the Roman citizenship and
are called Augustam, the title of their city being
Julia Gaditana. On the side facing Spain at a
distance of about 100 yards is another island one
mile long and one mile broad, on which the town of
Cadiz was previously situated ; Ephorus and Philistus
call this island Erythea, and Timaeus and Silenus
call it Aphrodisias, but its native name is the Isle
of Juno. The lai-ger island according to Timaeus is
known as Potimusa from its wells, but our peoplc call
it Tartesos and the Punic name is Gadir, which is
Carthaginian for a fence3 it was called Erythea,
because the original ancestors of the Carthaginians‚
the Tyrians, were said to have corne from the Red
Sea. This island is believed by some people to have
been the home of the Geryones whose cattle were
carried off by Hercules; but others hold that that
was another island, lying off Lusitania, and that an
island there was once called by the same name.

we must now give its complete dimensions, in order
that those who desire this information may not bc
left at a loss. Its length from the Don to Cadiz is
given by Artemidorus and Isidorus as 7714 miles.
Polybius stated the breadth of Europe from Italy
to the ocean as 1150 miles, but its exact magnitude
had not been ascertained even in his day. The length
of Italy itself up to the Alps is 1020 miles, as we
