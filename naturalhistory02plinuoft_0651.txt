fictions of childish absurdity, and belong to a mor-

sweet but credulous fancy ruins nature’s chief
blessing‚ death, and doubles the sorrow of one about
to die by the thought of sorrow to come hereafter
also; for if to live is sweet, who can find it sweet to
have done living? But how much easier and safer
for each to trust in himself, and for us to derive our
idea of future tranquillity from our experience of it
before birth!

acorns; she also invented grinding corn and making
flour in Attica (or, as others say, in Sicily), and
for this was deemed a goddess. Also she first gave
laws, though others have thought this was done by
Rhadamanthus.

I arn of opinion that the Assyrians have always had

invented in Egypt by Mercury, while others think it

instituted buying and seUing, and Father Liber the vintage.’
