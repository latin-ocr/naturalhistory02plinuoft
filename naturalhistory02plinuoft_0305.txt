and it is as it were isolated by Nature from the world,
having a destiny of its own between the two mighty
empires of Rome and Parthia, and at the first moment
of a quarrel between them always attracting the
attention of both sides. It is 337 miles distant from
Parthian Seleucia, generally known as Seleucia on
the Tigris, 203 miles from the nearest part of the
Syrian coast, and 27 miles less from Damascus.

Below the Desert of Palmyra is the district of

Stelendena, and Holy City, Beroea and Chalcis
already mentioned. Beyond Palmyra also a part of §§81.82.
this desert is claimed by Hemesa, and a part by
Elatium, which is half as far as Damascus is from
Petrae. Quite near to Sura is the Parthian town of
Philiscum on the Euphrates; from Philiscum to
Seleucia is a voyage of ten days, and about the same
to Babylon. At a point 594 miles from Bridgetown,
the Euphrates divides round the village of Massice,
the left branch passing through Seleucia itself into
Mesopotamia and falling into the Tigris as it flows
round that city, while the right-hand channel makes
for Babylon, the former capital of Chaldea, and
passing through the middle of it, and also through
the city called Mothris, spreads out into marshes.
Like the Nile, the Euphrates also increases in
volume at fixed periods with little variation, and
floods Mesopotamia when the sun has reached the
20th degree of the Crab3 but when the sun has
passed through the Lion and entered Virgo it begins
to sink‚ and when the sun is in the 29th degree of
Virgo it returns to its channel entirely.

XXII. But let us return to the coast of Syria, ,ma-Minor.-
adjoining which is Cilicia. Here are the river ξᾶξζξζᾝᾶια
Diaphanes, Mount Crocodile, the Gates of Mount nations.
