BOOK VI. xxvx. 99—101

the island of Aradus and that of Gauratae, both
inhabited by the Gyani tribe; at the middle of the
Persian Gulf the river Hyperis, navigable for mer-
chant vessels; the river Sitioganus, up which it is
seven days’ voyage to Pasargadae; the navigable
river Phrystimus; and an island that has no name.
The river Granis, carrying vessels of moderate size,
flows through Susiane, and on its right bank dwell the
Dexinmntani, who manufacture asphalt3 the river
Zarotis, the mouth of which is difficult to navigate
except for those familiar with it3 and two small
islands. Then comes a shallow stretch of water like
a marsh which nevertheless is navigable by way of
certain channels; the mouth of the Euphrates3
a lake formed in the neighbourhood of Charax by
the Eulaeus and the Tigris; then by the Tigris they
reached Susa. There after three nionths' voyaging
they found Alexander celebrating a festiva13 it was
seven months since he had left them at Patala.

Such was the route followed by the fleet of Alexander ; fea-roffam

but subsequently it was thought that the safest line is ,ἑοῖζᾰῑω
to start from Ras Fartak in Arabia with a west wind
(the native name for which in those parts is Hippalus α)
and make for Patale, the distance being reckoned
as 1332 miles. The following period considered it
a shorter and safer route to start from the same cape
and steer sor the Indian harbour of Sigerus‚⁶ and for a
long time this was the course followed, until a mer-
chant discovered a shorter route, and the desire for
gain brought India nearer3 indeed, the voyage is
made every year, with companies of archers on board,
because these seas used to be very greatly infested
by pirates.
