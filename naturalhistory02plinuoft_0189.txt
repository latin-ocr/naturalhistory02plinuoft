Solymnia, Eudemia and Nea, the last an island
sacred to Minerva3 across the Gulf of Athos lie four
islands, Piperi with the town of that name and formerly
called Evoenus, 9 miles off, Sciathos 15 miles, and
Embro with its town 88 miles3 the distance between
Embro and Mastusia on the Gallipoli Peninsula is
22 miles. Embro is 62} miles in circuit3 it is watered
by the river llissus. Twenty-two miles from Embro
is Stalimene‚ which lies 87 ⁰ miles from Mount Athos;
its circuit measures 115} miles, and on it are the towns
of Hephaestia and Myrina—the market place of the
latter is reached by the shadow of Mount Athos ὁ
at mid-summer. Six miles from Stalimene is Thasos,
a free state, formerly called Aeria or Aethria3 Abdera
on the mainland is 22 miles from Thasos, and
Athos 62} miles, and the island of Samothrace, a
free state, off the river Maritza, is the same distance
from Thasos, 32 miles from Embro, 22} from Stali-
mene, and 38 from the coast of Thrace3 its circuit
measures 35 miles, and on it rises Monte NettunO,
which is 10 miles high.c Embro gives the worst
anchoragc for vessels of all the islands. It is men-
tioned by Callimachus under its ancient name of
Dardania.

Between the Gallipoli peninsula and Samothrace,
about 15 miles from each, is the island of Skopelo,
and beyond it are Gethone, Lamponia, Alopeconnesus,
which is not far from Coelos the port of Gallipoli‚
and some others of no importance. We may also
specify the names of uninhabited islands in the Gulf
so far as we have been able to asccrtain them:
Avesticos, Sarnos, Cissyros, Charbrusa, Calathusa,
Scyllia, Dialeon, Dictaea, Melanthia, Dracanon,
