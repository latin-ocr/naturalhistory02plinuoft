Canopus, 1628 miles; Isidorus makes the distance
from T angier to Canopus 3599 miles, but Artemidorus
makes it 40 miles less than Isidorus.

VII. These seas do not contain very many islands. ᾒῑαέἆψίῖ
The most famous is Zerba, 25 miles long and 22 miles ‘ s rrrrr
broad, called by Eratosthenes Lotus Eaters’ Island.
It has two towns, Meninx on the side of Africa and
Thoar on the other side, the island itself lying off
the promontory on the right-hand side of the Lesser
Syrtis, at a distance of a mile and a half away. A
hundred miles from Zerba and lying off the left-
hand promontory is the island of Cercina, with the
free city of the same name3 it is 25 miles long and
measures half that distance across where it is widest,
but not more than 5 miles across at its end3 and
joined to it by a bridge is the extremely small island
os Cercinitis, which looks towards Carthago. About
50 miles from these is Lopadusa, 6 miles long3 then
come Gaulos and Galata, the soil of the latter having
the property of killing scorpions, that pest of Africa.
It is also said that scorpions cannot live at Clupea,
opposite to which lies Pantellaria with its town.
Opposite the Gulf of Carthage lie the two Aegi-
moeroi; but the Altars, which arc more truly rocks
than islands, are chiefly between Sicily and Sar-
dinia. Some authorities state that even the Altars
were formerly inhabitcd but that their level has
sunk.

VIII. In the interior circuit of Africa towards the Peoples os
south and beyond the Gaetulians, after an inter· mmmm·
mediate strip of desert, the first inhabitants of all
are the Egyptian Libyans‚ and then the people
called in Greek the White Ethiopians. Beyond
these are the Ethiopian clans of the Nigritae,
