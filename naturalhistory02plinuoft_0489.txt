called Epis, opposite to Meroe, which had been de-
stroyed before Bion wrote.

These are the places that were reported as far as
Meroe, though at the present day hardly any of them
still exist on either side of the river; at all events
an exploring party of praetorian troops under the
command of a tribune lately sent by the emperor
Nero, when among the rest of his wars he was
actually contemplating an attack on Ethiopian,
reported that there was nothing but desert. Never-
theless in the time of his late Majesty Augustus
the arms of Rome had penetrated even into those
regions, under the leadership of Publius Petronius,
himself also a member of the Order of Knighthood,
when he was Governor of Egypt. Petronius cap-
tured the Arabian towns of which we will give a list,
the only ones we have found there: Pselcis, Primi,
Bocchis, Cambyses' Market, Attenia and Stadissis,
