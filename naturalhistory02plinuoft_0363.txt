by a vast mountain range. Beyond Trebizond begins
the Armenochalybes tribe, and 30 miles further
Greater Armenia. On the coast before reaching
Trebizond is the river Pyxites, and beyond Trebizond
the Charioteer Sanni, and the river Absarrus with
the fortress of the same name in its gorge, 140 miles
from Trapezus. Behind the mountains of this dis-
trict is Hiberia, and on the coast the Charioteers,
the Ampreutae and the Lazi, the rivers Acampseon,
Isis, Mogrus and Bathys, the Colchian tribes, the
town of Matium, the River of Heracles and the cape
of the same name, and the Rion, the most celebrated
river of the Black Sea region. The Rion rises among 1¹1ae river
the Moschi and is navigable for ships of any size mm·
for 38³2* miles, and a long way further for smaller
vessels; it is crossed by 120 bridges. It had a
considerable number of towns on its banks, the most
notable being Tyndaris, Circaeus, Cygnus, and at
its mouth Phasis; but the most famous was Aea,
15 miles from the sea, where two very large tributaries
join the Rion from opposite directions, the Hippos
and the Cyaneos. At the present day the only town
on the Rion is Surium, which itself also takes its name
from a river that enters the Rion at the point up to
which we said that it is navigable for large vessels.
It also receives other tributaries remarkable for their
size and number, among them the Glaucus; at its
mouth is an island with no name, 70 miles from the
mouth of the Absarrus. Then there is another river,
the Charieis, the Saltiae tribe called of old the
Pine-seed-eaters‚ and another tribe, the Sanni;
the river Chobus flowing from the Caucasus through
the Suani territory; then Rhoan, the Cegritic
district, the rivers Sigania, Thersos, Astelphus and
