Zariasta from the river, but its name was afterwards
changed to Balkhfl This race occupies the oppo-
site side of the Hindu Kush over against the
sources of the Indus, and is enclosed by the river
Ochus. Beyond are the Sogdiani and the town os
Panda, and on the farthest confines of their territory
Alexandria, founded by Alexander the Great. At
this place there are altars set up by Hercules and
Father Liber, and also by Cyrus and Samiramis and
by Alexander, all of whom found their limit in this
region of the world, where they were shut in by the
river Syr Darya, which the Scythians call the Silis
and which Alexander and his soldiers supposed to be
the Don. But this river was crossed by Demo-
damas, the general of King Seleucus and King
Antiochus, whom we are chiefly following in this part
of our narrative; and he set up altars to Apollo
DidymaeuS.

XIX. Beyond are some tribes of Scythians. To ⁰ απ

these the Persians have given the general name
of Sacae, from the tribe nearest to Persia, but old
writers call them the Aramii‚ and the Scythians
themselves give the name of Chorsari to the Persians
and call Mount Caucasus Croucasis, which means
‘ white with snow.' There is an uncountable
number of tribes, numerous enough to live on equal
terms with the Parthians; most notable among
them are the Sacae, Massagetae, Dahae, Essedones,
Astacae, Rumnici, Pestici, Homodoti, Histi‚ Edonos,
Camae, Camacae, Euchatae‚ Cotieri, Authusiani,
Psacae, Arimaspi, Antacati, Chroasai and Oetaei;
among them the Napaei are said to have been
destroyed by the Palaei. Notable rivers in their
country are the Mandragaeus and the Caspasus.
