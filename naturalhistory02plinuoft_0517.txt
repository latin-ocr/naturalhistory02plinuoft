Lusitania. A 9-ft. gnomon throws an 8-ft. shadow.
The longest day-time is 152¹„ or, according to Nigidius,

The seventh division starts from the other side
of the Caspian Sea and passes above Collat‚ the

shadows, except that in part of the Venetian district
the shadow and the gnomon are equal. The longest

, Up to this point we have been setting forth the
results worked out by the ancients. The rest of the
earth's surface has been allotted by the most careful
among subsequent students to three additional
parallels: from the Don across the Sea of Azov and
the country of the Sarmatae to the Dnieper and so
across Dacia and part of Germany, and including
the Gallie provinces forming the coasts of the Ocean,
making a parallel with a sixteen-bour longest day;
the next across the Hyperboreans and Britain, with
a seventeen-hour day; the last the Scythian parallel
from the Ripaean mountain-range0 to 'l'hule,⁶ in
which, as we said above, there are alternate
periods of perpetual daylight and perpetual night.
