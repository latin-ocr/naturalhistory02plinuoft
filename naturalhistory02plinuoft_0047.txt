two capitals of the confederate state of the Vocontii,
Vasio and Lucus Augusti; and also unimportant
towns to the number of 19, as well as 24 assigned to
the people of Nimes. The Emperor Galba added
to the list two peoples dwelling in the Alps, the people

According to Agrippa the length of the province of
Narbonne is 370 miles and the breadth 248.

V. After this comes Italy, the first people of it ltaly: scs
being the Ligurians, after whom come Etruria, ἀπ’·
Umbria and Latium, where are the mouths of the
Tiber and Rome, the capital of the world, sixteen
miles from the sea. Afterwards come the coast of
the Volsci and of Campania, then of Picenum
and Lucania and the Bruttii, the southernmost point
to which Italy juts out into the sea from the almost
crescent-shaped chain of the Alps. After the Bruttii
comes the coast of Magna Graecia, followed by the
Sallentini, Paediculi‚d Apuli, Paeligni, Frentani,
Marrucini, Vestini, Sabini, Picentes, Gauls, Umbriam,
Tuscans, Venetians, Carni, Iapudes, Histri and Li-
burni. I am well aware that I may with justice be
considered ungrateful and lazy ifI describe in this
casual and cursory manner a land which is at once
the nursling and the mother of all other lands, chosen
by the providence of the gods to make heaven itself
