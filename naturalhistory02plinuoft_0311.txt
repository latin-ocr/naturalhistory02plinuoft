way at intervals, here the Phoenician Sea, here the
Black Sea, there the Caspian and the Hyrcanian,

owing to their impact the mountain twists about
between these obstacles, and nev ertheless sinuously

the Ripaean Mountains. The range is designated by
a number of names, receiving new ones at each point
