the Arachosii writers place the Dexendrusi on the
south side, adjoining a section of the Arachotae,
and the Paropanisadae on the north; and beneath
the Hindu Kush the town of Cartana, later called

then comes the region of the Ariani, whose town is
called Alexandria ⁶ after its founder; the Syndraci‚
Dangalae, Parapinae, Cataces and Mazi; near the
Hindu Kush the Cadrusi, whose town was founded by
Alexander. Below these places the whole country

Arian region, which is scorched by glom'ng heat
