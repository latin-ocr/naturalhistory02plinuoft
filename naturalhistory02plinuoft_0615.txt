BOOK VII. xmn. 137—141

O what a false meaning to attach to the title ! How
doomed to misfortune in the future! Were not his
victims more fortunate at the time when dying,

to be deemed the most eminent member of the
senate, to obtain great wealth' in an honourable w ay,

to leave many children, and to achieve supreme dis-

to his father’ s lot, and to that of no one else since
Rome’s foundation. It would be a lengthy matter
to refute this, and it is superfluous to do so as it is
