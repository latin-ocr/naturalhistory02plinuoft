BOOK VII. xxx1x. 128—XL. 131

when Attius of Pesaro was selling a skilled linguist
named Daphnis and Marcus Scaurus, Head of the
State, bid 700‚OOO sesterces. This has been exceeded,
and considerably, in our own time by actors when
buying their own freedom by means of their earnings,
inasmuch as already in the time of our ancestors
the actor Roscius is said to have earned 500,000
sesterces a year,——unless anybody expects a mention
in this place of the commissary in the Armenian
war carried on not long ago for Tiridates, whom Nero
liberated for 13‚000‚000 sesterces. But this was the
price paid for a war, not for an individual‚ just as in
truth when Clutorius Priscus bought one of Sejanus’s
eunuchs Paezon for 50,000‚OOO, this was the price of
lust and not of beauty. But Clutorius got away
with this outrageous affair during a period of national
mournin , as nobody had time to show him up.

XL. T e one race of outstanding eminence in virtue
among all the races in the whole world is undoubtedly
the Roman. What human being has had the greatest
happiness is not a question for human judgement,
since prosperity itself different people define in
different ways and each according to his own tem-
perament. If we wish to make a true judgement
and discard all fortune's pomp in deciding the
point, none among mortals is happy. Fortune deals
lavishly and makes an indulgent bargain with the
man whom it is possible justly to pronounce not
unhappy. In fact, apart from other considerations‚
assurcdly there is a fear that fortune may grow
weary, and this fear once entertained, happiness has
no firm foundation. What of the proverb that none
among mortals is wisc all the time? And would
that as many men as possible may dcem this proverb
