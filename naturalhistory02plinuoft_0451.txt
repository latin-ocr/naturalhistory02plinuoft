is Digba. But some statement about the Tigris
itself may also be suitable here. The source
of the Tigris is in a region of Greater Armenia,
and is clearly wisiblc„ being on level ground3 the
name of the place is Elegosine, and the stream
itself in its comparatively sluggish part is named
Diglitus, but where its flow accelerates, it begins
to be called the Tigris, owing to its swiftness—
tigris is the Persian word for an arrow. It flows
into Lake Aretissa, heavy objects thrown into which
always float on the surface‚ and which gives off
nitrous vapours. The lake contains a single speeies
of fish‚ which never enters the current of the Tigris
flowing through the lake, as likewise the fish of the
river do not swim out of its stream into the water
of the lake3 but the riven- travels on in a distinct
course and m'th a different colour, and when after
traversing the lake it comes against Mount Taurus,
it plunges into a cave, glides underground, and
bursts out again on the other side of the mountain.
The name of the place where it emerges is Zoaranda;
and the idcntity of the stream is proved by the fact
that objects thrown into it are carried through the
tunnel. Then it crosses a second lake called Thes-
pites, and again burrows into underground passages,
re-emerging 22 miles further on in the neighbourhood
of Nymphaeum. According to Claudius Caesar, the
course of the Tigris in the Archene district is so close
to that of the Arsanias that when they are in flood
they flow together, although without intermingling
their water53 that of the Arsanias being of less
speciflc gravity floats on the surface for a distance
of nearly four miles, after which the two rivers
separate, and the Arsanias discharges into the
