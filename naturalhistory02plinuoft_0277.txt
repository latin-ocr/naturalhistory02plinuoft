and it belches out, by many mouths it is true, into
the Egyptian Sea.‘² For a certain part of the year
however its volume greatly increases and it roams
abroad over the whole of Egypt and inundates the
land with a fertilising flood.

Various explanations of this rising of the river have
been given; but the most probable are either the
backwash caused by what are called in Greek the
Annual Winds,b which blow in the opposite direc—
tion to the current at that period of the year, the
sea outside being driven into the mouths of the
river, or the summer rains of Ethiopia which are
due to the same Annual Winds bringing clouds
from the rest of the world to Egypt. The mathe-
matician Timaeus produced a very recondite theory
—that the source of the Nile is a spring called
Phiala, and that the river buries itself in burrows
underground and breathes forth vapour owing to the
steaming hot rocks among which it hides itself3 but
that as the sun at the period in question comes
nearer the river water is drawn out by the force
of the heat and rises up and overflows, and with—
draws itself to avoid being swallowed up. This,
he says, begins to occur at the rising of the Dogstar‚
when the sun is entering the sign of the Lion, the
sun standing in a vertical line above the spring, at
which season in that region shadows entirely dis-
appear—though the general opinion on the contrary
is that the flow of the Nile is more copious when
the sun is departing towards the north, which
happens when it is in the Crab and the Lion, and
that consequently the river is dried up less them
and again when the sun returns to Capricorn and
towards the south pole its waters are absorbed and
