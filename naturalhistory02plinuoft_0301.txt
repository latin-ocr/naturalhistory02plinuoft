by two of the persons who have seen it nearest to
its sou1·ce*—Domitius Corbulo putting its source in
Mount Aga and Licinius Mucianus at the roots of
a mountain the name of which lie gives as Capotes,
twelve miles above Zimara. Near its source the
river is called Pyxurates. Its course divides first the
Derzene region of Armenia and then the Anaetie
from Cappadocia. Dascusa is 75 miles from Zimara3
and from Dascusa the river is navigable to Sartona,
a distance of 50 miles, to Melitene in Cappadocia

the tributary streams Lycus, Arsania and Arsanus.
At Elegea it encounters Mount Taurus, which how-
ever does not bar its passage although forming an
extremely powerful barricr 12 miles broad. The
river is called the Omma where it forces its way
into the range, and later, where it emerges, the
Euphrates; beyond the range also it is full of rocks
and has a violent current. From this point it forms
the frontier between the district of Arabia called
the country of the Orroei on the left and Commagene
on the right, its breadth being three cables’ length,
although even where it forces its passage through
the Taurus range it pcrmits ofa bridge. At Claudio-

and forcing it to take a southerly direction. Thus
this duel of nature becomes a drawn battle, the
