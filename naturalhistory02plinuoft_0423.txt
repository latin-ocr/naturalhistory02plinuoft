country than in ouis, but that we made more use of
our riches: with them nobody kept a slave, every-
body got up at sunrisc and nobody took a siesta
in the middle of the day3 their buildings were of
only moderate height; the price of corn was never
inflated; there were no lawcourts and no litigation3
the deity worshipped was Hercules3 the king was
elected by the people on the grounds of age and
gentleness of disposition, and as having no children,
and if he afterwards had a child, he was deposed,
to prevent the monarchy from becoming hereditary.
Thirty Governors, they told us, were assigned to the
king by the people, and capital punishment could
only be inflicted by a vote of a majority of these3
and even then there was a right of appeal to the
people‚ and a jury of seventy members was appointed
to try the case, and if these acquitted the accused
the thirty Governors were no more held in any
esteem‚ being utterly disgraeed. The king’s costume
was that ⁴² of Father Liber, and the other people wore
Arabian dress. If the king committed a delinquency
he was punished by being condemned to death,
though nobody executed the sentence, but the whole
of the people turned their backs on him and refused
to have any communication with him or even to speak
to him. Holidays, they told us, were spent in hunting‚
tiger hunts and elephant hunts being always the
most popular. Agriculture was industriously prac-
tised, but the vine was not grown, although orchard
fruit was abundant. They were also fond of fishing,
especially for turtle‚ the shells of which were used
as roofs for family dwellings-they were found
of so large a size. They looked upon a hundred
years as a moderate span of life.
