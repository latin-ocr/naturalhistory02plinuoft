Cordova. That the Celtici came from the Celtiberi
in Lusitania is proved by their religion, their language‚
and the names of their towns, which in Baetica are
distinguished by surnames: Seria has the additional
name of Fama Julia, Nertobriga that of Concordia
Julia‚ Segida that of Restituta Julia, Ugultunia that
of Contributa Julia (in which now is also included
the town of Curiga), Lacimurga that of Constantia
Julia, and Stereses the surname of Fortunales and
Callenses that of Aeneanici. Besides these places
there are in Celtica Acinipo, Arunda, Arunci,
Turobriga, Lastigi, Salpesa, Saepone, Serippo. The
other part of Baeturia, which we have said belongs
to the Turduli and to the jurisdiction of Cordova,
contains the not undistinguished towns of Arsa,
Mellaria, Mirobriga Regina, Sosintigi and Sisapo. To
the jurisdiction of Cadiz belong Regina, with Roman
citizens, Laepia Regia with Latin citizens, Carisa
surnamed Aurelia, Urgia surnamed Castrum J ulium,
and also Caesaris Salutariensis3 the tributary towns
of Besaro, Belippo, Barbesula, Blacippo, Baesippo,
Callet, Cappacum‚ Oleastro, Iptuci, Ibrona, Lascuta,
Saguntia, Saudo, Usaepo.

this was when its bounds extended as far as Carta-
gena: such extensions comparatively often give
rise to great errors in the measurements of distances‚
as they sometimes cause alterations in the boundary
of provinces and sometimes an increase or reduction
os the mileage of roads. During so long a period of
time the scas have been encroaching on the land 01
the shmes hav e been moving forward, and rivers have
formed curves or have straightened out their wind-
