shores of the Caspian‚ and extend to the Scythians,
with whom the Parthians live on terms of equality.
The remaining seven kingdoms are called the Lower
Kingdoms. So far as the Parthi are concerned‚
there has always been a country named Parthyaea
at the foot of the mountain range, already men-

tioned more than once, which forms the boundary5

of all these races. To the east of Parthyaea are the
Arii, to the south Carmania and the Ariani, to the
west the Pratitae, a Mcdian race, and to the north the
Hyrcani; and it is surrounded on all sides by desert.
The more remote Parthians are called the Nomads.
Short of the desert on the west side are the Parthian
cities mentioned above, Issatis and Calliope; north-
east is Pyropum, south-east Maria, and in the middle
Hecatompylos, Arsace, and the fine district of
Parthyene, Nisiaea, containing the city named
Alexandropolis after its founder.

At this point it is necessary also to indicate the
geographical position of the Medes, and to trace
the formation of the country round to the Persian
Sea, in order that the rest of the account that
follows may be more easily understood, Media lies
crosswise on the west side, meeting Parthia at an
angle, and so shutting off both groups of Parthian
kingdoms. Consequently it has the Caspian and
Parthian people on its east side, Sittacene, Susiane
and Farsistan on the south, Adiabene on the west,
and Armenia on the north. The Persians have always
lived on the shore of the Red Sea, which is the
reason why it is called the Persian Gulf. The coastal
region there is called Cyropolis, but the Greek name
of the place where it runs up towards the Medes is the
Great Staircase, from a steep gorge ascending the
