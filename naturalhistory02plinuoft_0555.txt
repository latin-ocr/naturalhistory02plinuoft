twelve infants were still-born at once. When,
however, a moderate interval of time separates two
conceptions, both may be successful, as was seen in
the instance of Hercules and his brother Iphicles and
in the case of the woman who bore twins of whom
one resembled her husband and the other an
adulterer; and also in that of the maidservant of
Marmara who, as a result of intercourse on the same
day, bore one twin resembling her master and
another resembling his steward, and that of another
woman who bore one twin at the proper period and
the other a five-months' child, and again of another
who after bearing a seven months' child was delivered
of twins three months later.

It is also well known that sound parents may have

case may be; that some marks and moles and even
scars reappear in the offspring, in some cases a birth-
mark on the arm reappearing in the fourth generation

family likeness, some a female child like its father
and a male child like themselves. One unquestioned
instance is that of the famous boxer Nicaeus‚ born
at Istambouh whose mother was the offspring of
