the Caucasus among the Gurdinian Mountains are the
Valli and the Suani, races never yet quelled, who
nevertheless work gold-mines. After these, right
on to the Black Sea, are a large number of tribes of
Charioteers and then of Achaei. Such is the present
state of one of the most famous regions in the world.

Some authorities have reported the distance
between the Black Sea and the. Caspian as not more
than 375 miles, while Cornelius Nepos makes it 250
miles: by such narrow straits is Asia for a second
time α beset. Claudius Caesar gives the dis-
tance from the Straits of Kertsch to the Caspian Sea
as 150 1111163,ὁ and states that Seleucus Nicator at
the time when he was killed by Ptolemy Ceraunus
was contemplating cutting a channel through this
isthmus. It is practically certain that the distance
from the Gates of the Caucasus to the Black Sea is
200 miles.

Xlll. The islands in the Black Sea are the Planc-
tae,⁶ otherwise named the Cyaneae or Symplegades,
and then Apollonia, called Thynias to distinguish
it from the islanda of the same name in Europe——
it is a mile away from the mainland and three
miles in circumferencc—and opposite to Pharnacea θ
Chaleeritis‚ called by the Greeks the Isle of Ares
and sacred to 1116 god of war3 they say that on it
there were birds which used to attack strangers with
blows of their wings.

XIV. Having now completed our description of the
interior of Asia let us in imagination cross the Ripaean
Mountains and proceed to the right along the shores
of the Ocean. This washes the coast of Asia towards
three points ofthe compass, under the name of Scy-
thian Oeean on the north, Eastern Ocean on the east
