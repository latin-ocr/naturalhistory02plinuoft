BOOK VII. xmm. 155-157

Illyria lived 500 years. Xenophon in his Coasting
Voyage says that a king of the island of the Lutmii
lived to 600, and—as though that were only a modest
fabrication—-that his son lived to 800. All of these
exaggerations were due to ignorance of ehronology,
because some people made the year coineide with
the summer, the winter being a second year, others
marked it by the periods of the four seasons‚ for
example the Arcadians whose years were three
months long, and some by the waning of the moon,
as do the Egyptians. Consequently with them even
individuals are recorded to have lived a thousand
ears.

y But to pass to admitted facts, it is almost certain
that Argathonius of Cadiz reigned for 80 years; his
reign is thought to have begun in his fortieth year.
It is not questioned that Masinissa reigned 60 years
and that the Sicilian Gorgias lived 108 years.
Quintus Fabius Maximus was augur for 63 years.
Marcus Perperna and reeently Lucius Volusius
Saturninus outlived all the persons whose votes in
debate they had taken as consuls ‘¹3 Perperna left
only seven of those whom as censor he had elected——
he lived to 98. In this matter it occurs to me to note
also that there has only been a single five-year
period in which no senator has died, from when
Flaccus and Albinus as censors performed the
purification ceremony to the next censors—begin-
ning 175 B.c. Marcus Valerius Corvinus completed
100 years, and there was an interval of 46 years
between his first and sixth consulships. He also
took his seat in the curule chair 21 times, which is a
record; but his length of life was equalled by the
pontifex Metellus.
