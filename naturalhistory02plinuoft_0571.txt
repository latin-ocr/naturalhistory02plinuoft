BOOK VII. xw. 74-76

that the body of Orestes dug up a at the command of
an oracle measured 10 ft. 6 in. Moreover, the famous
bard Homer nearly 1000 years ago never ceased to
lament that mortals were smaller of stature than in
the old days. In the case of Naevius Pollio the
annals do not record his height, but they show that
it was deemed portentous‚ because he was almost
killed by the people flocking round him. The tallest
person our age has seen was a man named Gabbara
brought from Arabia in the principate of his late
Majesty Claudius who was 9 ft. 9 in. in height.
Under his late Majesty Augustus there were two
persons 6 in. taller‚ whose bodies on account of this
remarkable height were preserved in the tomb in
Sallust’s Gardens; their names were Pusio and
Secundilla. When the same emperor was head of the
state the smallest person was a dwarf2 ft. 5 in. high
named Conopas, the pet of his granddaughter Julia,
and the smallest female was Andromeda, a freed—
woman of J ulia Augusta. Marcus Varro states
that the Knights of Rome Manius Maximus and
Marcus Tullius were 3 ft. high, and we have ourselves
seen their bodies preserved in coffins. It is a matter
of common knowledge that persons are born 18 in.
high and some taller‚ who complete their life’s course
at the age of three.

We find in the records that at Salamis the son of
Euthymenes grew to 4 ft. 6 in. in his third year;
he walked slowly, was dull of sense, became sexually
quite mature, had a bass voice, and was carried off
by a sudden attack of paralysis when he turned
three. We ourselves recently saw almost all these
features except sexual maturity in a son of the Knight
of Rome Cornelius Tacitus, Deputy Finance Minister
