the vastness of his wealth may be conjectured.
Further up country from these are the Monaedes
and the Suari, in whose domain is Mount Maleus
upon which shadows fall towards the north in winter
and towards the south in summer, for periods of
six months alternately. According to Baeton the
constellation of the Great Bear is only visible in this
region one time in the year, and only for a period of
a fortnight3 and Megasthenes says that the same
thing occurs in many other places in India. The
Indian name for their southern region is Diamasa.
The river J umna runs through the Palibothri country
into the Ganges between the towns of Muttra and
Chrysobora. In the region to the south of the
Ganges the tribes are browned by the heat of the
sun to the extent of being coloured, though not as
yet burnt black like the Ethiopians; the nearer they
get to the Indus the more colour they display. We
come to the Indus immediately after leaving the
Prasii, a tribe in whose mountain regions there is said
to be a race of Pygmies. Artemidorus gives the
distance from the Ganges to the Indus as 2100 miles.

XXIII. The Indus, the native name for which is
Sindus, rises on the east side of a ridge of Mount
Caucasus called Hindu Kush3 in its course it receives
nineteen tributaries, the best known being the
Jhelum which brings with it four other streams‚
the Cantaba which brings three, and the Chenab
and the Beas, themselves navigable rivers. Owing
however to a certain limitation in its supply of water
the Indus is nowhere more than (δὲ miles wide or
75 feet deep; and it forms an island os considerable
size named Prasiane and another smaller one named
Patale.⁰ The main river is navigable for a distance
