third port named Mokha, which is not called at on
the voyage to India, and is only used by merchants
trading in frankincense and Arabian persumes.
Inland there is a town, the residence of the king
of the district, called Sapphar, and another called
Save. But the most advantageous way of sailing to
India is to set out from Cella; from that port it
is a 40 days' voyage, if the Hippalus ‘² is blowing, to
the first trading—station in India, Cranganore—not a
desirable port of call, on account of the neighbouring
pirates, who occupy a place called Nitriae,b nor is it
specially rich in articles of merchandise 3 and further-
more the roadstead for shipping is a long way from
the land, and cargoes have to be brought in and
carried out in boats. The king of Muziris, at the date
of publication, was Caelobothras. There is another
more serviceable port, belonging to the Neacyndi
tribe, called Porakad3 this is where king Pandion
reigned, his capital being a town in the interior a
long way from the port, called Madura; while the
district from which pepper is conveyed to Becare
in canoes made of hollowed tree-trunks is called
Cottonara. But all these names of tribes and
ports or towns are to be found in none of the previous
writers, which seems to show that the local condi-
tions of the places are changing. Travellers set sail
from India on the return voyage at the beginning of
the Egyptian month Tybis, which is our December,
or at all events before the sixth day of the Egyptian
Mechir, which works out at before January 13 in our
calendar—so making it possible to return home in
the same year. They set sail from India with a south-
east wind,c and after entering the Red Sea, continue
the voyage with a south-west or south wind.
