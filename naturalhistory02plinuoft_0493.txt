BOOK VI. xxxv. 184-187

22 miles, Tergedus 103 miles. The report stated
that the island of Gagaudes is half—way between
Syene and Meroe, and that it was after passing this
island that the birds called parrots were first seen,
and after another, named Articula‚ the sphingion
ape, and after Tergedus dog-faced baboons. The
distance from Tergedus to Nabata is 80 miles, that
little town being the only one among those mentioned
that survives3 and from Nabata to the island of
Meroe is 360 miles. Round Meroe, they reported,
greener herbage begins, and a certain amount of
forest came into view, and the tracks of rhinoceroses
and elephants were seen. The actual town of Meroe
they said is at a distance of 70 miles from the first
approach to the island, and beside it in the channe]
on the right hand as one goes up stream lies another
island, the Isle of Tados‚ this forming a harbour3
the town possesses few buildings. They said that
it is ruled by a woman, Candace‚ a name that has
passed on through a suceession of queens for many
years; and that religious ceremonies take place in a
temple of Hammon in the town and also in shrines of
Hammon all over the district. Moreover at the time
of the Ethiopic dominion this island was extremely
celebrated. It is reported that it used to furnish
250,000 armed men and 3000 artisans.⁰ At the
present day there are reported to be forty-five other
kings of Ethiopia. But the whole race was called
Aetheria, and then Atlantia, and finally it took its
name from Aethiops the son of Vulcan. It is by no
means surprising that the outermost districts of this
region produce animal and human monstrosities‚
considering the capacity of the mobile element of
fire to mould their bodies and carve their outlines.
