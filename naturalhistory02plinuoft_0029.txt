BOOK III. 1. 11—13

The towns of the jurisdiction of Hispalis are Celti,
Axati, Arua, Canama, Evia, Ilipa surnamed Ilpa
Italica3 on the left bank is the colony Hispal sur-
named Romulensis, while on the opposite side are
the towns Osset surnamed Julia Constantia, Ver-
gentum or Juli Genius, Orippo, Caura, Siarum,
and the river Maenuba, a tributary of the Guadal-
quivir on its right. Between the estuaries of the
Guadalquivir are the towns of Nabrissa, surnamed
Veneria, and Colobana, with two colonies, Hasta,
which is called Regia, and inland Asido, which is
called Caesarina.

The river Xenil, joining the Guadalquivir at the
place in the list already mentioned, washes the colony
of Astigi, surnamed Augusta Firma, from which point
it becomes navigable. The other colonies in this
jurisdiction exempt from tribute are Tucci, surnamed
Augusta Gemella, Iptuci or Virtus Julia, Ucubi or
Claritas Julia, Urso or Genetiva Urbanorum3 and
among these once was Munda, which was taken with
the younger Pompey.‘² The free towns are Old
Astigi and Ostippo, with the tributary towns of
Callet, Callicula, Castra Gemina, Ilipula Minor,
Marruca, Sacrana, Obulcula, Oningis‚ Sabora and
Ventippo. At no great distance, on the Maenuba.
another navigable river, are the settlements of
Olontigi, Laelia and Lastigi.

The region stretching from the Guadalquivir to the
river Guadiana beyond the places already mentioned
is called Baeturia, and is divided into two parts and
the same number of races, the Celtici bordering on
Lusitania, of the jurisdiction of Seville, and the
Turduli, who dwell on the borders of Lusitania and
the Tarragon territory, but are in the jurisdiction of
