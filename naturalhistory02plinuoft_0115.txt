Lambro through Lago di Pusiano—all of these
streams being tributaries of the Po.

The length of the Alps from the Adriatic to the
Mediterranean is given by Caelius as 1000 miles;
Timagenes puts it at 25 miles less. Their breadth
is given by Cornelius Nepos as 100 miles, by Livy
as 375 miles,⁸² but they take their measurements
at different points3 for occasionally the Alps exceed
even 100 miles in breadth, where they divide Germany
from Italy, while in the remaining part they are as
it were providentially narrow and do not cover 70
miles. The breadth of Italy at the roots of the Alps,
measured from the river V ar through Vado, the
port of Savo, Turin, Como, Bremia, Verona, Vicenza,
Oderzo, Aquileia, Trieste and Pola, to the river Arsa,
amounts to 745 miles.

and Menoncaleni, and next to the Carni the peoples
formerly called Taurisci and now Norici3 adjoining
these are the Raeti and Vindelici. All are divided
into a number of states. The Raeti are believed
to be people of Tuscan race driven out by the Gauls;
their leader was named Raetus. Then, on the side
of the Alps towards Italy, are the Euganean races
having the Latin rights, whose towns listed by Cato
number 34. Among these are the Triumpilini,l>
a people that sold themselves⁶ together with their
lands, and then the Camunni& and a number of
similar peoples, assigned to the jurisdiction of the
neighbouring municipal towns. Cato before men-
tioned considers the Lepontiie and Salassi! to be
of Tauriscan origin, but almost all other authors give
