Ithaca, Dulichium, Same, and Crocyle. Cephallenia,
formerly called in Greek the Black Island, is 10
miles from Paxo, and measures 93 miles in circum-
ference3 Same has been demolished by the Romans,
but still possesses three towns. Between Same and
the coast of Achaia lies Zante, distinguished by its
fine town and remarkable for the fertility of its soil3
it was at one time called Hyrie. It is 25 miles from
the southern part of Cephallenia, and on it is the
celebrated mountain of Elatus.‹1 It measures 36
miles in circumference. At a distance of 15 miles
from Zante is Ithaca, on which is Monte Stefano;
its whole circumference measures 25 miles. The
distance from it to the Peloponnesian promontory of
Araxus is 15 miles. Off Ithaca in the open sea are
Asteris and Prote, and off Zante at a distance of 35
miles to the south-east are the two Strophades,
called by other people the Plotae. Off Cephallenia
is Letoia, off Pylos the three Sphageae and off
Messene the three Oenussae.

In the Messenian Gulf are the three Thyrides, and [stands

with the town of that name—the former name of
this island was Porphyris; it lies 5 miles from Cape
Malea, which is dangerous to circumnavigate because
of the narrowness of the sti-ait. In the Gulf of
Nauplia are Pityusa, Arine and Ephyre; opposite
the territory of Hermioneb Tricarenus, Aperopia,
Colonis and Aristera; opposite that of Troezen,
Calauria half a mile away, Plateis, Belbina, Lasia
and Baucidias3 opposite Epidaurus, Cecryphalos
and Pityoncsus 6 miles from the mainland. Fifteen
miles from Pityoncsus is Aegina, a free state, which
is 18 miles long as you sail past it, and 20 miles
