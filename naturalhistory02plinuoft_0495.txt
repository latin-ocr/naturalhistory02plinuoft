BOOK VI. xxxv. 187—190

It is certainly reported that in the interior on the
east side there are tribes of people without noses,
their whole face being perfectly flat, and other tribes
that have no upper lip and others no tongues. Also
one section has the mouth closed up and has no
nostrils, but only a single orifice through which it
breathes and sueks in drink by means of oat straws,
as well as grains of oat, which grows wild there, for
food. Some of the tribes communicate by means of
nods and gestures instead of spee0h3 and some were
unacquainted with the use of fire before the reign of
King Ptolemy Lathyrus in Egypt. Some writers
have actually reported a race of Pygmies living among
the marshes in which the Nile rises. On the coast,
in a region which we shall describe later, there is a §1⁰7-
range of mountains of a glowing red colour, which
have the appearance os being on fire.

After Meroe all the region is bounded by the Cave-
dwellers and the Red Sea, the distance from Napata
to the coast of the Red Sea being three days'
journey3 in several places rainwater is stored for the
use of travellers, and the district in between produces
a large amount ofgold. The parts beyond are occupied
by the Atabuli, an Ethiopian tribe3 and then, over
against Meroe, are the Megabarri, to whom some
give the name of Adiabari; they have. a town
named the Town of Apollo, but one division of them
are Nomads, and live on the fiesh of elephants.
Opposite to them, on the African side, are the
Macrobii, and again after the Megabarri corne the
Memnones and Dabelli, and 20 days’ journey further
on the Critensi. Beyond these are the Dochi, next
the GymneteS, who never wear any clothes, then the
Anderae, Mattitae and Mesanches: the last are
