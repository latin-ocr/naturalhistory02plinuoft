BOOK VI. ιν. 14-v. 17

Chrysorrhoas, the Absilae tribe, the forti-ess of
Sebastopol 100 miles from Phasis, the Sanicae tribe,
the town of Cygnus, the river and town of Pem'us;
and then tribes of the Charioteers with a variety of
names.

stated, one side sloping down towards the Black Sea
and the Sea of Azov, and the other towards the
Caspian and Hyrcanian Sea. The tribes occupying
almost all the rest of the coasts are the Blackcloaks
and the Coraxi, with the Colchian city of Dioscurias
on the river Anthemus, now deserted, but once so
famous that according to Timosthenes 300 tribes
speaking different languages used to resort to it; and
subsequently business was carried on there by Roman
traders with the help of a staff of 130 interpreters.
Some people think that Dioscurias was founded
by the chariotcers of Castor and Pollux, Amphitus
and Thelcffius, from whom it is virtually certain that
the Charioteer tribe are descended. The town of
Heracleum is 100 miles from Dioscurias and 70 miles
from Sebastopol. The tribes herc are the Achaei,
Mardi and Cercetae, and after these the Serri and
Cephalotomi. In the interior of this region was the
extremely wealthy town of Pityus, which was sacked
by the Charioteers. Behind Pityus are the Epagerri-
tae, a Sarmatian people on the Caucasus range, and
after them come the Sauromatians. It was with
this tribe that Mithridates⁰ took refuge in the
principate of Claudius, and from him we learn that
there is a neighbouring tribe, the Thali, who on the
eastern side extend to the mouthb of the Caspian
