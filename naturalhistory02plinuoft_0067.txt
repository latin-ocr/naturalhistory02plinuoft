the goddess Angerona, to whom sacrifice is offered
on December 21, is represented in her statue with a
sealed bandage over her mouth.

Romulus left Rome possessing three or, to accept
the statement of the authorities putting the number
highest, four gates. The area sui-rounded by its
walls at the time of the principato and censorship
of the Vespasians,“ in the 826th yearb of its foundation,
measured 13 miles and 200 yards in circumference,
embracing seven hills. It is itself divided into
fourteen regions, with 265 crossways with their
guardian Lares.⁶ If a straight line is drawn from
the milestone standing at the head of the Roman
Forum to each of the gates, which to-day number
thirty-seven (provided that the Twelve Gatesd be
counted only as one each and the seven of the old
gates that exist no longer be omitted), the result
is a total of 20 miles 765 yards in a straight line.
But the total length of all the ways through the
districts from the same milestone to the extreme
edge of the buildings, taking in the Praetorians’
Camp, amounts to a little more than 60 miles. If
one were further to take into account the height of
the buildings, a very fair estimate would be formed,
that would bring us to admit that there has been no
city in ‘the whole world that could be compared to
Rome in magnitude. On the e ist it is bounded by
the Dyke of Tarquinius Superbus, a work among
