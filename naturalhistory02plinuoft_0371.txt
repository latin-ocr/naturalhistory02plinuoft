in the interior. I do not deny that my description
of it will differ in many points from that of the old
writers, as Ι have devoted much care and attention to
ascertaining thoroughly the recent events in that
region frome Domitius Corbulo and the kings sent from
there 35 suppliants or king’ s children sent as hostages.
W e will however begin with thc Cappadocian tribe.
This extends farthest into the interior of all the
peoples of Pontus, passing on its left-hand side Lesser
and Greater Armenia and Commagene and on its
right all the tribes of Asia mentioned above3 it
spreads over a very large number of peoples‚ and
rises rapidly in elevation towards the east in the
direction of the Taurus range, passing Lycaonia,
Pisidia and Cilicia, and then advances above the
district of Antiochia, the part of it called Cataonia
reaching as far as the department of Antiochia
named Cy rrestica. Consequently the length of Asia
at this point is 1250 miles and its b1eadth 640
miles.

IX. Greater Armenia begins at the Parihedri
Mountains, and is separated from Cappadocia, as we
have said, by the river Euphrates and, when the
Euphrates turns aside,a from Mesopotamia by the
equally famous river Tigris. Both rivers rise in
Armenia, and it forms the beginning of Mesopotamia,
the tract of countiy lying between these two 1·ivers;'’
the intervening space is occupied by the Orroean
Arabs. It thus extends its frontier as far as Adiabene,
where it is enclosed by ranges of mountains that
stretch across it; here it spreads its width on the
left, crossing the Aras, to the river Kur, while its
length reaches right to Lesser Armenia, from which
it is separated by the river Absarrus‚ which flows
