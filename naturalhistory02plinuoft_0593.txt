XXIX. Who could make an honours class- list of Casas
geniuses‚ ranging through all the kinds of systems and¹ emm em,

perhaps it is agreed that no genius has ever
existed who was more successful than Homer the
bard of Greece, whether he be judged by the form
or by the matter of his work. Consequently Alex-
ander the Great—for so lordly an assessment will
be effected best and least invidiously by the most
supreme tribunals—when among the booty won from
the Persian King Darius there was a case of unguents
made of gold and enriclied wi'sh pearls and preeious
stones‚ and when his friends pointed out the various
uses to which it could be put, since a warrior soiled
with warfare had no use for perfume, said, “ No, by
Hercules, rather let it be assigned to keeping the
works of Homer ’'—so that the most precious achieve-
ment of the mind of man might be preserved in
the richest possible produci: of the craftsman's art.
Alexander also gave orders at the sack of Thebes
for 'she household and home of 'the poet Pindar to
be spared3 and he felt the native place of the philo-
sopher Aristotle fo be his own, and blended that
evidence of kindliness with all the glory of his
exploits.‘² Apollo at Delphi exposed the murderers
of the poet Archilochus. When Sophocles the
prince of the tragic busl·in died, ὸ Father Liber gave
orders for his burial though the Spartans were
besieging the city w alls, theo Spartan king rLysander
receiving frequent admonitions in dr eams ‘to permit
the interment of the darling of the god) The king
enquired what persons had expircd at Athens and had
no difficulty in understanding which among them the
god meant,and he granted an armistiee forthe funeral.
