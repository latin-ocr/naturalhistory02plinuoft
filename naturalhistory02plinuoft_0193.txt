between the two strasts, the Dardanelles and Kaffiz,
measures according to Polybius 500 miles. The whole
cireumferenee of the Black Sea according to Varro
and the old authorities generally is 2150 miles, but
Cornelius Nepos adds 350 miles, while Artemidorus
makes it 2119 miles, Agrippa 2540, and Mucianus
2425. There is a similar difference of opinion as to
the measurement of the European shore, some fixing
it at 1479 miles and others at 1100. Marcus Varro
gives the measurement as follows: from the mouth
of the Black Sea to Apollonia 187} miles3 from there
to Collat the same; to the mouth of the Danube
125 ; to the Dnieper 2503 to the town of Cherronesus
of the Heracleotae 375 miles; to Kertsch, by some
called Bosporus, the last point on the coast of Europe,
212} miles—the total making 1337} miles. Agrippa
makes it 540 miles from Istamboul to the river
Danube and 635 miles from the Danube to Kertsch.

The actual Sea of Azov, which receives the Don
flowing dmm from the Ripaean Mountains‚‘¹ the
river being the extreme boundary between Europe
and Asia, is said to measure 1406, or according to
other authorities 1125, miles in circumference. The
distance in a straight line between the entrance of
the Sea of Azov and the mouth of the Don is agreed
to be 375 miles. The inhabitants of the coasts of
this great Gulf as far as Istere have been mentioned
in our account of Thrace.

We then come to the mouths of the Danube.
