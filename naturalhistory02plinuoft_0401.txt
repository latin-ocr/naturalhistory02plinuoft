footsteps of Alexander the Great. Diognetus and
Baeton‚the surveyors of his expeditions‚xvrite that the
distance from the Caspian Gates to the Parthian City
of Hecatompylos is the number of miles that we stated
above;⁰ from thence to the city of Alexandriab of
the Arii, which Alexander founded, 575 miles, to
the city of the Drangae, Prophthasia, 199 miles, to
the town⁶ of the Arachosii 565 miles, to Kabul
175 miles, and thence to Alexander’s Town 50 miles
(in some copies of this record we find different
numbers): this city is stated to be situated imm&

Kabul and the Indjan town of Peucolatis 237
miles, and thence to the river Indus and the town
of Taxilla 60 miles, to the famous river Jhelum
120 miles, to the not less notable Beas 390 miles
—this was the terminus of Alexander’s journeys,
although he crossed the river and dedicated altars

1123, to Rhodapha 569 (others give 325 miles in this
space), to the town of Callinipaza 167ss (others 165),
thence to the confluence of the river ,Jumna and
the Ganges 625 (a great many add 133), to the town
of Patna 425, to the mouth of the Ganges 6373.
The races worth mentioning after leaving the
Hemodi Mountains (a projection of which is called
