its dimensions on the south-east side along the coast
of Cadusia and Albania as 725 miles, from there
through the territories of the Atiaci, Ainarbi and
Hyrcani to the mouth of the river Zonus 600 miles,
and from there to the mouth of the Syr Dariaa
300 miles, making a total of 1575 miles. Artemi-
dorus subtracts 25 miles from this total. Agrippa
states that the Caspian Sea and the races surrounding
it, including Armenia, bounded on *the east by the
Chinese Ocean, on the west by the ranges of the
Caucasus, on the south by those of the Taurus and on
the north by the Scythian Ocean, so far as is known
extend 480 miles in length and 290 miles in breadth.
But there are some authors who give the entire cir-
cuit of the sea in question from the straits⁶ as 2500
miles.

Its waters make their way into this sea by a narrow
mouth of considerable length; and where it begins
to widen out it curves obliqucly with crescent-
shaped horns, as though descending from the mouth
to the Sca of Azov‚ in the likeness of a sickle, as
Marcus Varro states. The first part of it is called
the Scythian Gulf‚ because the inhabitants on both
sides are Scythians, who hold communication across
the narrows, on onc side being the Noxnads and the
Sauromatae, who have a variety of names, and on
the other the Abzoae, with just as many. Starting
at the entrance, on the right-hand side the actual
point of the mouth is occupied by the Scythian tribe
of the Udini3 then along the coast arc the Albani,
said to be descended froin Jason‚ aster whom the sea
at that point is called the Alban Sea. This race
overflows the Caucasus Mountains and, as previouslv § 29.
