BOOK VI. xxxa. 220

The same authorities also place two parallels before
what we made the starting point, the first running
through the island of Mero& and Ptolemyâ€™s Lodge
built on the Red Sea for the sake of elephant-
hunting, in which parallel the longest day will be
1212- hours, and the second passing through Syene
in Egypt, with a 13-hour day3 aud they also add
half an hour to each of the parallels up to the last.
So far as to the geography of the world.
