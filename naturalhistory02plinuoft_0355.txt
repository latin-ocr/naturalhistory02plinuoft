BOOK VI

Ι. Tim Euxine or Black Sea, formerly because of its The Black·
inhospitable roughness called the Ακάηε,α owing to a δρα·
peculiar jealousy on the part of Nature, which here
indulges the sea's greed without any limit, actually
spreads into Europe and Asia. The Ocean was not
content to have encircled the earth, and with still
further cruelty to have reft away a portion of her
surface‚ nor to have forced an entrance through a
breach in the mountains and rent Gibraltar away
from Africa, so devouring a larger area than it left
remaining, nor to have swallowed up a further space
of land and flooded the Sea of Marmara through
the Dardanelles3 even beyond the Straits of Con—
stantinople also it widens out into another desolate
expense, with an appetite unsatisfied until the Sea
of Azov links on its own trespass to its encroachments.
That this event occurred against the will of the earth
is proved by the number of narrows, and by the small-
ness ofthe gaps left by Nature’s resistance‚ measuring
at the Dardanelles 875 paees‚²’ at the Straits of Con-
stantinople and Kertsch the passage being actually
fordable by oxen—which fact gives both of them their
name c ;—and also by a certain harmonious affinity con-
tained in their dissemrance, as the singing of birds
and barking of dogs on one side can be heard on the
other, and even the interchange of human speech,
conversation going on between the two worlds‚ save
when the actual sound is carried away by the wind.
