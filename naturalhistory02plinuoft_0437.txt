BOOK VI. xxvi. 106-xxv111. 100

We will now return to our main subject.

XXVII. Nearchus writes that the length of the Carmania.
coast of Carmania is 1250 miles, and the distance
from its beginning to the river Sabis 100 miles;
and that from that river to the river Ananis, a space
of 25 miles, there are vineyards and arable land.
The district is called Armysia; and towns of Car-
mania are Zetis and Alexandria.

XXVIII. Moreover in this region the sea then The Καὶ
makes a double inroada into the land; the name Ῐὶἶὸἵῇἵξ
given to it by our countrymen is the Red Sea, while Gulf,
the Greeks call it Erythrum, from King Erythras, or,
according to others, in the belief that the water is
given a red colour by the reflexion of the sun, while
others say that the name comes from the saud and
the soil, and others that it is due to the actual water
being naturally of such a character. However, this
sea is divided into two bays. The one to the east,
is called the Persian Gulf, and according to the
report of Eratosthenes measures 2500 miles round.
Opposite is Arabia, with a coastline 1500 miles in
length, and on its other side Arabia is encompassed
by the second bay, named the Arabian Gulf; the
ocean flowing into this is called tho Azanian Sea.
The width of the Persian Gulf at its entrance some
make five and others four miles; the distance in a
straight line from the entrance to the innermost
part of the Gulf has been ascertained to be nearly
1125 miles, and its outline has been found to be in
the likeness of a human head. Onesicritus and
Nearchus write that from the river Indus to the
Persian Gulf and from there to Babylon by the
marshes of the Euphrates is a voyage of 1700 miles.

In an angle of Carmania are the Turtle-eaters‚
