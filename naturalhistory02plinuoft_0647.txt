hood died when with the same ballet·dancer Mysticus,
the leading beauty of the day. However, the most
enviable case of a peaceful end is one recorded by our
forefathers, that of Marcus Ofilius Hilarus: he was
an actor in comedy, and having had a considerable
success with the public on his birthday and while
giving a party, when dinncr was served called for a hot
drink in a tankard, and at the same time picked up
the mask that he had worn on that day and while
gazing at it transferred the wreath from his own
head to it, and in this attitude lay quite stiff with-
out anybody noticing‚ until the guest on the next
couch warned him that his drink was getting

cold .

These are happy instances, but there are countless m‘c‘ .

numbers of unhappy ones. Lucius Domitius, a man
of very distinguished family, who was defeated at
Marseilles and was taken prisoner, also by Caesar,
at Corfinium‚<1 grew tired of life and drank poison,
but afterwards made every effort to save his life.
It is found in the official records that at the
funeral of Felix the charioteer of the Reds one
of his backers threw himself upon the pyre—a
pitiful story—and the opposing backers tried to
prevent this score to the record of a professional by
asserting that the man had sainted owing to the
quantity of scents! Not long before, the corpse of
Marcus Lepidus, the man of distinguished family
whose death from anxiety about his divorce we have
recorded above? had been dislodged from the pyre
by the violence of the flame, and as it was impossible
to put it back again because of the heat, it was burnt
naked with a fresh supply of faggots at the side of
the pyre.
