fertility in women if when the eyes have been
anointed with a drug the saliva contains traces
of it.

Moreover‚ it is known that children cut their first
teeth when six months old, the upper ones mostly

and that some children are born having teeth—two
distinguished instanees are Manius Curius, who
received the surname Dentatus in consequence, and
Gnaeus Papirius Carbo. In the regal period this
occurrence was considered a sign of bad luel< in
females: Valeria was born with teeth, and the
soothsayers in reply to inquiry prophesied that she

with the genitals closed3 this is proved by the case
of Cornelia the mother of the Gracchi to be a sign
of bad luck.) Some infants are born with a ridge
of bone instead of teeth ; this was the case as regards
