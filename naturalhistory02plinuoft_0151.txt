Domitius Nero! The Peloponnese measures 190
miles across from Cape Malea to the town of Vostitza
on the Gulf of Corinth, and in the other direction 125
miles from Elis to Epidauros and 68 miles from
Olympia through Arcadia to Argos. (The distance
between Olympia and Pylos has been given alreadyst)
Nature has compensated for the inroads of the sea
by the mountainous character of the entire region,
there being 76 peaks in all.

from Megara, the colony on the opposite side of the
Isthmus from Pagae. These two towns are situated
where the Peloponnese projects, and stand on either
side of the Isthmus, as it were on the shoulders of
Hellas, Pagae and also Aegosthena ⁰ being assigned
to the jurisdiction of Megara. On the coast are the
harbour of Porto Cocosi‚ the towns Leandra and
Cremmyon, the Scironian Rocks d six miles in length,

the harbours of Piraeus and Phaleron, 55 miles from
the Isthmus, and joined by wall to Athens 5 miles
away. Athens is a free city, and requires no further
advertisement here as her celebrity is more than
ample. In Attica are the springs of Cephisia,
Larine, and the Nine W'ells of Callirrhoe, and the
mountains of Brilessus,e Aegialeus, Icarius, Hymettus
