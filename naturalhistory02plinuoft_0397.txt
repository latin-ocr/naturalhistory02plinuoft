is complete agreement as to the races—the range of
mountains called the Himalayas. Here begins the
Indian race, bordering not only on the Eastern Sea
but 011 the southern also, which we have designated
the Indian Ocean. The part facing east stretches533-
in a straight line until it comes to a bend, and at the
point where the Indian Ocean begins its total length
is 1875 miles; while from that point onward the
southerly bend of the coast according to Eratosthenes
covers 2475 miles, finally reaching the river Indus,
which is the western boundary of India. A great
many authors however give the entire length of
the coast as being forty days' and nights’ sail and
the measurement of the country from north to south
as 2850 miles. Agrippa says that it is 3300 miles
long and 2300 miles broad. Posidonius gives iis
measurement from north-east to south-east, making
the whole of it face the west side of Gaul, of
which he gives the measurement from north-west
to south-west; and accordingly he shows by an
unquestionable line of argument that India has the
advantage of being exposed to the current of the
west wind, which makes it healthy. In that coun-
try the aspect of the heavens and the rising of the
stars are different, and there are two summers and
two harvests yearly, separated by a winter accom-
panied by etesian winds, while at our midwinter it
enjoys soft breezes and the sea is navigable. Its
races and cities are beyond counting, if one wished
to enumerate all ofthem. For it has been brought to
knowledge not only by the armed forces of Alexander
the Great and the kings who succeeded him, Seleucus
and Antiochus, and their admiral of the fleet Pat-
rocles having sailed round even into the Hyrcanian
