BOOK VII. 11. 24-26

mountains in the east of India (it is called the
district of the Catarcludi); this is an extremely
swift animal, sometimes going on all fours and some-
times standing upright as they run, like human
beings; because of their specd only the old ones
or the sick are caught. Tauron gives the name of
Choromandae to a forest tribe that has no speech but
a horrible scream, hairy bodies, keen grey eyes and
the teeth of a dog. Eudoxus says that in the south
of India men have feet eighteen inches long and the
women such small feet that they are called Sparrow-
feet. Megasthenes tells of a race among the Nomads
of India that has only holes in the place of nostrils,
like snakes, and bandy-legged3 they are called the
Sciritae. At the extreme boundary of India to the
East, near thc source of the Ganges, he puts the Astomi
tribe, that has no mouth and a body hairy all over3
they dress in cottonwool and live only on the air they
breathe and the scent they inhale through their
nostrils ; they have no food or drink except the differ-
ent odours of the roots and flowcrs and wild apples,
which they carry with thern on their longer journeys
so as not to lack a supply of scent3 he says they can
easily be killed by a rather strongcr odour than
usual. Beyond these in the most outlying mountain
region we are told of the Three-span men and Pygmies,
who do not excced three spans, i.e. twenty-seven
inches, in height3 the climate is healthy and always
spring-like, as it is protected on the north by a range
of mountains; this tribe Homer α has also recorded
as being beset by cranes. It is reported that in
springtime their entire band, mountcd on the backs
of rams and she-goats and armed with arrows, goes
in a body down to the sea and eats the cranes’ eggs
