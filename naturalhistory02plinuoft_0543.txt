BOOK VII. 11. 30—111. 33

Indians have union with wild animals and the off-
spring is of mixed race and half anima13 that among
the Calingi, a tribe of the same part of India, women
conceive at the age of five and do not live more than
eight years, and that in another part men are born
with a hairy tail and extremely swift, while others
are entirely covered by their ears.

The river Arabis is the frontier between the
Indians and the Oritae. These are acquainted with
no other food but fish, which they cut to pieces with
their nails and roast in the sun and thus make bread
out of them, as is recorded by Clitarchus. Crates
of Pergamum says that the Cavemen beyond Ethiopia
are sw ister than horse-33 also that there are Ethiopians
more than tw elxe feet in height, and that this racc
is called the Syrbotae. The tribe of the Ethiopian
nomads along the river Astragus towards the north
called the Menismini is twenty days’ journey from
the Ocean3 it lives on the milk of the animals that
we call dog-headed apes, herds of which it keeps in
pastures, killing the males except for the purpose of
breeding. In the deserts of Africa ghosts of men
suddenly meet the traveller and vanish in a moment.

These and similar varieties of the human racc
have been made by the ingenuity of Nature as toys
for herself and marvels for us. And indeed who
could possibly recount the various things she does
every day and almost every hour? Let it suffice foi
the disclosure of her power to have included whole
races of mankind among her marvels. From these
we turn to a few admitted marv els m the case of the
indiv idual human being.
