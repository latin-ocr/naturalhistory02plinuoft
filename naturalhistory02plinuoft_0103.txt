ground and emerges again in the district of Vibius
Market. It rivals all other rivers in celebrity3 its
Creek name was Eridanus, and it is famous as the
scene of the punishment of Phaethon.a The melting
of the snows at the rising of the Dogstar causes it
to swell' ln v;olun1e but though its flooding does more
damage to the fields adjacent than to vessels, never-
theless it claims no part of its plunder for itself, and
where it deposits its spoil it bestows bounteous
fertility. Its length from its source is 300 miles, to
which it adds 88 by its windings‚ and it not only
receives navigable rivers from the Apennines and the
Alps, but also immense lakes that discharge them-
selves into it, and it carries down to the Adriatic
Sea as many as 30 streams in all. Among these the
best-known are: flowing from the Apennine range,
the Jactum, the Tanaro, the Trebbia (on which is
Piacenza), the Taro, the Enza, the Secchia, the
Panaro and the Reno3 flowing from the Alps, the
Stura, Orco, two Doras, Sesia‚ Ticino, Lambm, Adda,
Oglio and Mincio. Nor does any other river increase
so much in volume in so short a distance3 in fact,
the vast body of water drives it on and scoops out
its bed with disaster to the land, although it is
diverted into streams and canals between Ravenna
and Altino over a length of 120 miles; neverthe-
l‘ess where it discharges its water more widely it
forms what are called the Seven Seas.

The Po is carried to Ravenna by the Canal of
Augustus; this part of the river is called the Padusa,
