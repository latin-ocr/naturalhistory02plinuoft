IV. Transformation of females into males is not an 011a neq eos

idle story. We find in the Annals that in the Ι·

Cassius Longinus a girl at Casinum was changed

recorded that he personally saw at Argos a man
named Arescon who had been given the name of
Arescusa and had actually married a husband, and
then had grown a beard and developed masculine
attributes and had taken a wife3 and that he had
also seen a boy with the same record at Smyrna.

male on the day of marriage to a husband3 this was

in the womb is more frequent in the case of males,

ten3 a child born before the seventh month is usually
still born. Only those conceived the day before or
the day after full moon, or when there is no moon,
are born in the seventh month. It is a common thing
