famous city of the East and not of Judaea only,
and Herodium with the celebrated town of the
same name.

The source of the river Jordan is the spring of Thelordan
Panias from which Caesarea described later takes ῗῖἶᾶὴὲεα,
its second name. It is a delightful stream, winding §74-
about⁰ so far as the conformation of the locality
allows‚ and putting itself at the service of the people
who dwell on its banks, as though moving with
reluctance towards that gloomy lake, the Dead Sea,
which ultimately swallows it up, its much-praised
waters mingling with the pestilentia] waters of the
lake and being lost. For this reason at the first
opportunity afforded by the formation of the valleys
it uidens out into a lake usually called the Sea of
Gennesareth. This is 16 miles long and 6 broad,
and is skirted by the pleasant towns of Bethsaida
and Hippo on the east, El Kereh on the south (the
name of which place some people also give to the
lake), and Tabariah with its salubrious hot springs
on the west. The only product of the Dead Sea is
bitumen, the Greek word for which gives it its
Greek name, Asphaltites. The bodies of animals do
not sink in its waters, even bulls and camels floating;
this has given rise to the report that nothing at all
can sink in it. It is more than 100 miles long, and
fully 75 miles broad at the broadest part but only
6 miles at the narrowest. On the east it is faced
by Arabia of the Nomads‚ and on the south by
Machaerus, at one time next to Jerusalem the most
important fortress in Judaea. On the same side
there is a hot spring possessing medicina] value, the
name of which, Callirrhoe, itself proclaims the
celcbrity of its waters.
