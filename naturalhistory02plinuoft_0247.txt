It is well ascertained that the next people are
the Aethiopian tribe called the Perorsi. Juba, the
father of Ptolemy, who was the first ruler to hold
sway over both the Mauretanias, and who is even
more distinguished for his renown as a student than
for his royal sovereignty, has published similar facts
about Mount Atlas, and has stated in addition that
a plant grows there called the euphorbia,‘¹ named
after his doctor who discovered it; in a volume
devoted solely to the subject of this plantb he sings
the praises of its milky juice in very remarkable
terms, stating it to be an aid to clear sight and
an antidote against snake-bite and poisons of all
kinds.—This is enough, or more than enough, about
Mount Atlas.

The province of Tangier is 170 miles in length.
It contains the following tribes: the Moors (from
whom it takes its name of Mauretania), by many
writers called the Maurusii, were formerly the lead-
ing race, but they have been thinned by wars and
are now reduced to a few families. The next race
to this was previously that of the Masaesyli, but
this has been wiped out in a similar manner. The
country is now occupied by the Gaetulian tribes, the
Baniurae and the Frce State, by far the most power-
ful os them all, and the Nesimi, who were formerly
a section of the Autoteles, but have split off from
them and formed a separate tribe of their own
in the direction of the Aethiopians. The province
itself produces elephants in its mountainous district
on the eastern side and also on Mount Ceuta and
the range of peaks called the Seven Bro†hers ⁶ from
