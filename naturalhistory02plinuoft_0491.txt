BOOK VI. xxxv. 181-184

where there is a cataract of the Nile the noise of
which affects people dwelling near it with deafness;
he also sacked the town of Napata. The farthest
point he reached was 870 miles from Syene3 but
nevertheless it was not the arms of Rome that made
the country a desert: Ethiopi‘l was worn out by
alternate periods of dominance and subjection in ·ι
series of wal-s with Egypt, having been a famous
and powerful country even down to the Troj·1n
wars, when Memnon was king· , and the stories about
Andromeda show that it dominated Syria and the
coasts of the Mediterranean in the time of King
Cepheus.

Simil·11·ly there have also been various repoits as
to the dimensions of the country, which were first
given by Dalion, who sailed up a long way beyond
Meroe, and then by Aristocreon and Bion and
Basilis, and also by the younger Simonides, who
stayed at Meroe for five years while writing his
account of Ethiopia. Further, Timosthenes, who com-
manded the navies of Philadelphus, has stated the
distance from Syene to Meroe as sixty days' journey,
without specifying the mileage per diem, while
Eratosthenes gives it as 625 miles and Artemidorus
as 600 miles ; and Sebosus says that from the extreme
point of Egypt to Meroe is 1672 miles, whereas thc
authors last mentioned give it as 1250 ‘² miles. But all
this discrepancy has recently been ended, inasmuch
as the expedition sent by Nero to explore the
country have reported that the distance from Syene
to Meroe is 945 miles, made up as follows: from
Syene to Holy Mulberry 54 miles, from there to
Tama 72 miles through the district of the Ethiopian
Euonymites, to Primi 120 miles, Acina 64 miles, Pitara
