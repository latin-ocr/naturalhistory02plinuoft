subject also I must do what l did when I spoke about
the heavens—touch upon particular points and only a
few of the stars. I merely ask my readers to remem-
ber that I am hastening on for the purpose of setting
forth in detail all the contents of the entire world.
In shape, then, Italy much resembles an oak leaf,
being far longer than it is broad, bending towards the
left at its top and ending in the shape osan Amazon’s
shield‚‹² the projection in the centre being called
Cocynthos, while it sends out two horns along bays
of crescent shape, Leucopetra on the right and
Lacinium on the left.⁶ Its length extends for 1020
miles, beginning from Aosta at the foot of the Alps
and passing through Rome and Capua in a winding
course to the town of Reggio situated on its shoulder,
where begins the curve, as it were, of the neck. The
measure would be much greater if the line were
carried on to Lacinium, but with that bend the line
would seem to diverge to one side. The breadth
varies, being four hundred and ten miles between
the rivers Var and Arsa where they flow into the
Mediterrancan and the Adriatic, but about at the
middle, in the neighbourhood of the city of Rome,
from the mouth of the river Pescara, which flows into
the Adriatic Sea, to the mouths of the Tiber‚ its
breadth is 136 miles, and a little less from Castrum
Novum on the Adriatic Sea to Palo on the Tuscan
Sea, in no place exceeding a width of 200 miles.
The circuit of the entire coast from the Var round to
the Arsa is 2049 miles. Its distanccs from the
countries that surround it are as follows: from Istria
and Liburnia in certain places 100 miles, from Epirus
and Illyricum, 50 miles, from Africa, according to
Marcus Varro, less than 200, from Sardinia 120, from
