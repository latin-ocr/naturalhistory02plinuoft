Aphrodisium, the colony of Antium, the river and
island called Astura, the river Ninfa, the Roman
Bulwarks‚ Circello, once an island surrounded by a
boundless sea,¹² if we are to believe Homer, but now
surrounded by a plain. The facts that we are able
to publish for the information of the world on this
matter are remarkable. Theophrastus, the first
foreigner to write with special care about the Romans
—for Theopompus, before whom nobody mentioned
them, merely states that Rome was taken by the
Gauls‚ and Clitarchus, the next after him, only that
an embassy was sent to Alexander—Theophrastus,

given the measurement of the island of Circello as
80 furlongs in the volume that he wrote in the
archonship of Nicodorus at Athens, which was the
440th yearl> os our city. WVhatever land therefore
has been joined to the island beyond the circum-
ference of 10 miles was added to Italy after that
year. Another marvel not far from Circello is the
Pomptine Marsh, a place which Mucianus, who was
three times consul, has reported to be the site of 24
cities. Then comes the river Aufentum, above which
is the town of Tarracina, called Anxur in the dialect
of the Volsci, and the site of Amyclae, or Amynclae,
the town destroyed by serpents, then the place
called the Grottoes, Lake Fundanus, the port of
Gaeta, the town of Formiae, called also Hormiae,
the ancient abode, it has been thought, of the Laestry-
gones. Beyond this formerly stood the town of
Pirae, and still exists the colony of Minturnae, through
which runs the river Liris, once called Clanis; and
