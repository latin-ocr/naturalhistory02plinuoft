tribune was found to intercede, and he was recalled
from the very threshold of death3 and subsequently

won the titles of Balearicus and Dahnaticus, while
he himself was already Macedonicus.‘² But evenis

the pyre by his children who had themselves won
triumphs, so that even his obsequies were a triumphal
procession. Assuredly it is no firnily founded
