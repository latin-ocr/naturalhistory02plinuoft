has not been ascertained‚ and so far as is known,
only part of it is inhabited, its natives being the
Hilleviones, who dwell in 500 villages, and call their
island a second world. Aeningia is thought to be
equally big. Some authorities report that these
regions as far as the river Vistula are inhabited by
the Sarmati‚ Venedi, Sciri and Hirri, and that there
is a gulf named Cylipenus‚ with the island of Latris
at its mouth, and then another gulf, that of Lagnus,
at which is the frontier of the Cimbri. The Cimbrian
promontory projects a long way into the sea, forming

the most noteworthy of these are Burcana? called

beans growing there, and the island which by the
soldiery is called Glass Island from its amber, but
by the barbarians Austeravia, and also Actania.

The whole of the sea-coast as far as the German river o

agreement among the writers who report about them.
The Greek writers and some of our own have given
the coast of Germany as measuring 2500 miles,
while Agrippa makes the length of Germany includ-
ing Raetia and Noricum 686 miles and the breadth
248 miles, (XIV.) whereas the breadth of Raetia alone
almost excccds that figure3 though to be sure it was
only conquered about the time of Agrippa's death—
for Germany was explored many years after, and that
not fully. If one may be allowed to conjecture, the
coast will be found to be not much shorter than the
Greek idea of it and the length given by Agrippa.

There are five German races: the Vandals, who Germanu-
