than itsclf,⁶ as we have said, seeing how enormously
it is pressed together on one side by the ocean and

northern side than on the southe1·n.⁶ On the nearest
coast is situated Hither or Tarragonian Spain3 along
the sca-coastd from the Pyrenees are the forest of
the Vascones, Olarso, the towns of the Varduli,
Morogi, Menosca, Vesperies and the port of Amanum,
