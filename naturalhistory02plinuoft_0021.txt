any history, and that though their names are
mentioned, it is only as forming a portion of the
world and of the natural universe.

The whole circuit of the earth is divided into three Thrqe
parts, Europe, Asia and Africa. The starting point ⁶⁰⁷²²²²²⁶⁷¹‘⁸'
is in the west, at the Straits of Gibraltar, where the owrauar.
Atlantic ocean bursts in and spreads out into the
inland seas. On the right as you enter from the ocean

them3 the boundaries are the river Don and the
river Nile. The ocean straits mentioned are fifteen
miles long and five miles broad, from the village
of Mellariaa in Spain to the White Capeb in
Africa, as given by Turranius Gracilis, a native
of the neighbourhood, while Livy and Cornelius
Nepos state the brcadth at the narrowest point
as seven miles and at the widest as ten miles: so
narrow is the mouth through which pours so boundless
an expanse of water. Nor is it of any great depth,
so as to lessen the marvel, for recurring streaks of
whitening shoal-water terrify passing keels, and con-
sequently many have called this place the thrcshold
of the Mediterranean. At the narrowest part of the
Straits stand mountains on either side, enclosing the
channel, Ximiera in Africa and Gibraltar in Europe;
these were the limits of the labours of Hercules, and
consequently the inhabitants call them the Pillars
of that deity, and believe that he cut the channel
through them and thereby let in the sea which had
