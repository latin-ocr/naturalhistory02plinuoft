Sallee‚ situated on the river of the same name; this
town is on the very edge of the desert, 'and is beset
by herds of elephants, but much more seriously

springs on the side facing Africa, where sruits of
all kinds spring up of their own accord with such
luxuriance that pleasure never lacks satisfaction.

silence like that of the desert, so that a speechless
awe creeps into the hear-ts of those who approach

the clouds and reaches the neighbourhood of the
moon’s orb; also that at night this peak flashes with
frequent sires and swarms with the wanton gambols
of Goat-Pans and Satyrs, and eehoes with the music
of flutes and pipes and the sound of drums and

country.

There were also once extant some notes‘1 of the
Carthaginian commander Hanno, who at the most
flourishing period of the Punic state was ordered to
explore the circuit of Africa. It is Hanno whom
