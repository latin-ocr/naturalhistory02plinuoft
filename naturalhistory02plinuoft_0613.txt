following on disasters‚ or what immeasurable disasters
except when following on enormous joys? XLIII.
She preserved the senator Marcus Fidustius for 36⁰

years after his proscription by Sulla, but only to pro-
scribe him a second time: he survived Sulla, but he
lived to see Antony, and it is known that Antony
proscribed him for no other reason than that he had
been proscribed before! It is true she willed that
Publius Ventidius should alone win a triumph from
the Parthians, but she also in his boyhood led him
captive in Gnaeus Pompeius’s triumph after Asculum
—albeit Masurius states that he was led in triumph
twice, and Cicero that he was a mule-driver for an
army bakery, and many authorities say that in his
youth he supported his poverty by foot-slogging in
the ranks! Also the elder Cornelius Balbus was
consul, but he was impeached and handed over to a
court ofjustice to decide as to his legal liability to a
flogging—he being the first foreigner and actual
native of the Atlantic coast to have held an honour ὁ
refused by our ancestors even to Latium. Lucius
Fulvius also is one of the notable examples, having
been consul of the Tusculans at the time of their
revolt and after coming over haw'ng been at once
honoured with the same office by the Roman nation:
he is the only man who ever in the same year in
which he had been Rome’s enemy won a triumph
from the people whose consul he had been. Lucius
Sulla is the sole human being hitherto who has
assumed the surname Fortunate, in fact achievmg
the title by civil bloodshed and by making war upon
his country, And what tokens of good fortune
were his motive? His success in exiling and slaugh—
tering so many thousands of his fellow-countrymen?
