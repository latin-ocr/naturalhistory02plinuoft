BOOK VI. xxm. 96—99

to begin with, no sufficiently clear account is
given of the position of the city of Timbertown,
founded by Alexander, which was their starting
point, nor is the river on which it stood indicated.
Nevertheless they give the following places worth
mentioning : the town of Arbis, founded by Nearchus
during his voyage, and the river Arbium, navigable
by ships, and an island opposite to Arbis, 8} miles
distant3 Alexandria, founded in the territory of
this race by Leonnatus at the order of Alexander3
Argenus, with a serviceable harbour3 the navigable
river Tonberum, in the neighbourhood of which are
the Parirae3 then the Fish-eaters, covering so wide
a space of coast that it took 30 days to sail past them ;
the islanda called the Isle of the Sun and also the
Couch of the Nymphs, the soil of which is red in
colour, and on which all animals without exception
die, from causes not ascertained3 the Ori tribe;
the Carmanian river Hyctanis, affording harbourage
and producing gold. The travellers noted that it
was here that the Great and Little Bear first became
visible, and that Arcturus is not visible at all on some
nights and never all night long3 that the rule of the
Persian kings extended to this point3 and that
copper, iron, arsenio and red-lead are mined here.
Next there is the Cape of Carmania, from which it
is a passage of five miles to cross to the Arabian
tribe of the Macae on the opposite coast; three
islands, of which only oracta, 25 miles from the main-
land, has a supply of fresh water and is inhabited3 four
islands quite in the gulf, off the coast of 1³arsistan—-
in the neighbourhood of these the fleet was terrified
by sea-serpents 30 ft. long that swam alongside—;
