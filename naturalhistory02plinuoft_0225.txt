the error being obvious3 they have put here, with
an alteration in the spelling of the name, the Arro-
trebae, whom we spoke of before we came to the
Celtic Promontory.

Mistakes have also been made in regard to the
important rivers. From the Minho, which we spoke
of above, the distance to the Agueda according to
Varro is 200 miles, though others place the latter
elsewhere and call it the Limaea3 in early times it
was called the River of Forgetfulness, and a great
many stories were told about it. Two hundred miles
from the Douro is the Tagus, the Mondego coming
between them ; the Tagus is famous for its auriferous
sands. At a distance of nearly 160 miles from the
Tagus is Cape St. Vincent, projecting from nearly
the middle of the front of Spain. The distance from
Cape St. Vincent to the middle. of the Pyrenees is
stated by Varro to amount to 1400 miles; from St.
Vincent to the Guadiana, which we indicated as the
boundary between Lusitania and Baetica, he puts
at 126 miles, the distance from the Guadiana to
Cadiz adding another 102 miles.

The peoples are the Celtici, the Turduli, and on the
Tagus the Vettones ; and between the Guadiana and
Cape St. Vincent the Lusitanians. The notable
towns on the coast, beginning at the Tagus, arc:
Lisbon, famous for its mares which conceive from
the west wind; Alcazar do Sal, called the Imperial
City ; Santiago de Cacem ς Cape St. Vincent, and the
other promontory called the Wedge ; ⁰ and the towns
of Estombar, Tavira and Mertola.

The whole province is divided into three associa-
tions‚ centred at Merida, Beja and Santarcm. It
consists of 45 peoples in all, among whom there are
