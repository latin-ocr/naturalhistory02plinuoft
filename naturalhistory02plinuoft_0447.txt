‘200 ft. high and 50 ft. wide (the Assyrian foot
measures 3 inches more than ours). The Euphrates
flows through the city, with marvellous embank-
ments on either side. The temple of Jupiter Belus ‘²
in Babylon is still standing—Belus was the discoverer
of the scicnce of astronomy ; but in all other respects
the place has gone back to a desert, having been
drained ofits population by the proximity of Seleucia,
founded for that purpose by Nicator not quite 90
miles away, at the point where the canalised
Euphrates joins the Tigris. Howcver, Seleucia is
still described as being in the territory of Babylon,
although at the present day it is a free and indepen-
dent city and retains the Macedonian manners.
It is said that the population of the city numbers
600‚000; that the plan of the walls resembles the
shape of an eagle spreading its wings3 and that its
territory is the most fertile in the whole of the east.
For the purpose of drawing away the population of
Seleucia in its turn, the Parthians founded Ctesiphon,
which is about three miles from Seleucia in the
Chalonitis district, and is now the capital of the
kingdoms of Parthia. And after it was found that
the intended purpose was not being achieved, another
town was recently founded in the neighbourhood by
King vologesus, named vologesocerta. There are
in addition the following towns in Mesopotamia:
Hippareni—this also a schoolb of Chaldaean learn-
ing like Babylon—situated on a tributary of the
river Narraga, from which the city-state takes its
name (the walls of Hippareni were demolished
by the Persians); also Orcheni, a third seatb of
Chaldaean learning, is situated in the same neighbour-
hood towards the south3 and next Notitae and
Orothophanitae and Gnesiochartae.
