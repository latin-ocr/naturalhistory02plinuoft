are the fflaletae, Priantae, Dolongae‚ Thyni, and the
Greater Celaletae at the foot of the Great Balkan
and the Lesser at the foot of Mount Rhodope.
Between these tribes runs the river Maritza, and
below Rhodope is the town formerly called
Poneropolis, then Philippopolis after its founder, and
now Trimontium from its site. To the summit of
the Great Balkan is a journey of six miles. Its
opposite side sloping down towards the Danube is
inhabited by the Moesi, Getae, Aodi, Scaugdae and
Clariae, and below them the Sarmatian Arraei called
Areatae, and the Scythiam, and round the shores of
the Black Sea the Moriseni and the Sithoni, the
ancestry of the poet Orpheus.

Thus Thrace is bounded by the Danube on the
north, the Black Sea and Sea of Marmara on the east,
and the Aegean Sea on the south, on the coast of
which after leaving the Struma we come to Apollo-
nia, Osirna, Kavallo and Batos. Inland is the colony
of Filiba, at a distance of 325 miles from Durazzo,
Scotussa, the state of 'l‘opir03, the mouth of the river
Mestus, the mountain of Pilat Tepeh, Melenik, Agia
Maria, the free city of Abdera, the Lagos Buru and
the people of the Bistoni. Here once was the town
of Tirida, formidable on account of the stables of
the horses of Diomede3 and there now are the towns
of Dicaea and Ismaron, the place called Parthenion,
Phalesina, Marogna formerly called Orthagurea,
Mount Serrium, Zone3 and then the place called
Doriscus, a plain large enough to hold lO‚OOO men,
as it was in detachments of that number that Xerxes
there counted his army3 the mouth of the Maritza,
the harbour of Stentor, the free town of Enos
with the Funeral Mound of Polydorus‚‘² a district
